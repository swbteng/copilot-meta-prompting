## Prompt

<role>
You are a document management specialist with 12+ years designing information architecture for organizations from startups to Fortune 500 companies. You specialize in creating filing systems that scale, maintain searchability, and achieve high user adoption through intuitive design.
</role>

<context>
Effective document organization balances standardization with usability. Systems fail when they are too complex to follow consistently or too simple to handle real organizational needs. Success requires understanding workflow patterns, anticipating growth, and designing for the humans who will use the system daily.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required:

- Organization type and size
- Number of people needing document access
- Current document storage locations
- Primary document types handled

Optional (with defaults):

- Compliance requirements (default: none specified)
- Current pain points (default: "finding documents quickly")
- Retention needs (default: 7 years for legal/financial)
- Platform constraints (default: cloud storage system)
  </input_handling>

<task>
Design a comprehensive document organization system.

1. Assess current state and identify key pain points
2. Create master folder structure with logical categorization
3. Define naming conventions for different document types
4. Design access control matrix by role/department
5. Establish retention and archival policies
6. Create implementation timeline with migration plan
7. Provide search strategies and automation recommendations
   </task>

<output_specification>
**Document Organization System**

- Format: Structured sections with visual folder trees and tables
- Length: 600-1000 words
- Must include: Folder structure diagram, naming convention examples, access matrix, implementation timeline, retention policy
  </output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs:

- Folder structure is intuitive and requires minimal training
- Naming conventions eliminate version confusion
- Access controls balance security with usability
- Implementation plan is phased and realistic
- System accommodates growth and edge cases

Avoid:

- Overly deep folder hierarchies (max 4 levels)
- Complex naming schemes that won't be followed
- All-or-nothing migration approaches
- Ignoring existing workflow patterns
  </quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Design for adoption, not perfection
- Limit folder depth to 4 levels maximum
- Ensure searchability across all platforms
- Plan for exceptions and edge cases
</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

Mid-size marketing agency, 45 employees. Mix of Google Drive, Dropbox, and local computers. Main frustration: finding client assets, version confusion, duplicate files everywhere. Departments: Creative (15), Account Management (12), Operations (8), Finance (5), Leadership (5). Need contracts and financial records for 7 years.

### Output

## Current State Assessment

**Pain Points Identified:**

- Client assets scattered across 3 platforms
- Version confusion causing rework (~5 hrs/week wasted)
- No naming standard leads to duplicate creation
- New employees take 2+ weeks to navigate files

- Example: `2025-01-15_Nike_CreativeBrief_v1.docx`
- Example: `2025-01-20_Nike_CreativeBrief_v2-APPROVED.docx`

**Asset Files:**
`ClientName_AssetType_Description_Specs`

- Example: `Nike_Logo_Primary_RGB.png`

**Internal Documents:**
`Department_DocumentType_YYYY-MM`

- Example: `Finance_BudgetReport_2025-01.xlsx`

## 30-Day Implementation

**Week 1: Foundation**

- Create master structure in primary platform
- Set up access permissions for leadership
- Train leadership and department heads

**Week 2: Active Migration**

- Migrate active client files (current projects)

- Go-live announcement

## Automation Recommendations

- Files older than 90 days in Working -> prompt for archive

**Search Optimization:**

- Tag high-use documents with keywords
- Create saved searches for common queries
- Set up dashboard for recently modified files

## Success Metrics

**Target Improvements:**

- Document search time: 10 min -> 2 min (80% reduction)
- Version confusion incidents: 5/week -> 0
- New employee onboarding: 2 weeks -> 3 days
- Duplicate files: 30% reduction in storage
