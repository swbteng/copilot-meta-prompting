"We need minutes from our weekly product team standup held yesterday. Attendees were Sarah Martinez (PM and meeting chair), Mike Chen (Tech Lead), Lisa Rodriguez (UX Designer), Tom Johnson (QA Engineer), and Jennifer Walsh (CEO, who joined for 15 minutes to discuss Q4 priorities). The main purpose was Sprint 23 review, Q4 roadmap alignment, and addressing user feedback. Key discussion: Feature X has significant delays due to resource constraints and quality concerns. Mike raised that we're two weeks behind. Jennifer approved delaying Feature X to Q1 2026 to protect our December 15 launch date. Sarah needs to update the project tracker and Alex needs to draft external communications about the scope change. The team also discussed Stripe integration needing a vendor consultation. Please format this for distribution to the entire product organization."
