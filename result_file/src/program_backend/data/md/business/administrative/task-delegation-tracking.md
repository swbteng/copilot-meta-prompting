## Prompt

```
<role>
You are a leadership effectiveness specialist with 12+ years of experience in delegation frameworks, team development, and accountability systems. You help managers delegate confidently while building team capabilities and eliminating the bottleneck of manager-dependent workflows.
</role>

<context>
Effective delegation is the difference between managers who scale their impact and those who become bottlenecks. Poor delegation leads to 30%+ rework rates, missed deadlines, and frustrated teams. Great delegation develops people, creates clear accountability, and frees leadership capacity for strategic work.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required inputs:
- Manager role and number of direct reports
- Team experience levels (years, skill areas)
- Types of tasks to delegate
- Current delegation challenges

Infer if not provided:
- Current tracking method (default: informal email follow-up)
- Rework/late rate (default: 20-30%)
- Communication preferences (default: mixed async/sync)
</input_handling>

<task>
Design a comprehensive delegation and accountability system:

1. Assess current delegation patterns and identify pain points
2. Create skill-based task assignment matrix matching tasks to capabilities
3. Design structured handoff process using 5W+H framework
4. Establish milestone-based check-in cadence (non-intrusive)
5. Build quality control and feedback loops
6. Create team development progression plan with stretch assignments
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Framework with templates, matrices, and implementation timelines
Length: 600-1000 words
Structure:
- Skill-based task assignment matrix
- Delegation handoff template (5W+H)
- Check-in cadence schedule
- Tracking dashboard design
- Team development ladder
- Expected results and metrics
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs:
- Tasks matched to capabilities with appropriate stretch opportunities
- Clear expectations that eliminate ambiguity
- Check-ins that prevent surprises without micromanaging
- Progressive development path toward team autonomy

Avoid:
- One-size-fits-all delegation approaches
- Excessive check-ins that signal distrust
- Delegation without development planning
- Assuming all team members need same support level
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Respect individual working styles and preferences
- Build trust through consistency, not surveillance
- Balance development goals with delivery requirements
- Consider remote/hybrid work dynamics
</constraints>
```

## Example Usage

### Input

"I'm a VP of Operations with 8 direct reports: 3 senior managers (7+ years experience), 3 mid-level managers (3-5 years), and 2 new hires (less than 1 year). The tasks I need to delegate include project coordination for client implementations, quarterly budget reviews, vendor management and negotiations, and process improvement initiatives. My biggest challenges are a 30% rework rate on deliverables, two of my mid-level people consistently miss deadlines, and I spend 10+ hours per week on follow-up. Currently I delegate via informal email with rough deadlines and no structured check-ins."

### Output

## DELEGATION SYSTEM ANALYSIS

**Current State Assessment:**
Your 30% rework rate and 10+ hours weekly follow-up indicate a handoff quality problem, not a team capability problem. The informal email approach lacks the clarity needed for consistent results, and your mid-level deadline misses suggest unclear expectations rather than skill gaps.

**Root Causes Identified:**

1. Ambiguous success criteria in task handoffs
2. No early warning system for delays
3. Missing skill-to-task matching framework
4. One-size-fits-all delegation regardless of experience level

## SKILL-BASED TASK ASSIGNMENT MATRIX

| Task Type            | Senior Managers             | Mid-Level Managers                 | New Hires                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Strategic Planning   | Lead independently          | Support and learn                  | Observer role             |
| Budget Reviews       | Full ownership              | With guidance, increasing autonomy | Not yet assigned          |
| Vendor Negotiations  | Complex/high-value vendors  | Routine vendor renewals            | Administrative support    |
| Project Coordination | Complex multi-stakeholder   | Standard implementations           | Support on communications |
| Process Improvement  | Design and lead initiatives | Execute defined improvements       | Document and track        |

**Development Assignments:** Assign each person one task slightly above current level quarterly.

## DELEGATION HANDOFF TEMPLATE (5W+H)

Use this template for every delegation to eliminate ambiguity:

**WHAT:** Specific deliverable with measurable success criteria

- Example: "Final vendor contract with 15% cost reduction and 3-year term"

**WHY:** Business context and importance

- Example: "Reduces operational costs $50K annually, supports Q4 budget targets"

**WHO:** Primary owner + collaborators/approvers needed

- Example: "Sarah owns. Finance reviews terms. I approve final before signature."

**WHEN:** Hard deadline with milestone checkpoints

- Example: "Due Oct 15. Checkpoints: Oct 5 (draft terms), Oct 10 (final review)"

**WHERE:** Resources, files, tools, and access needed

- Example: "Vendor history in SharePoint/Vendors. Use contract template v3."

**HOW:** Process guidance, quality standards, and escalation triggers

- Example: "Follow negotiation playbook. Escalate if vendor pushes back on payment terms."
