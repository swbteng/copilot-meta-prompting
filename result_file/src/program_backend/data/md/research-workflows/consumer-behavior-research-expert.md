## Example Usage

### Input

We operate an e-commerce platform for home goods with a 35% cart abandonment rate. Average order value is $275 with products ranging from $100-500. Our customers are primarily homeowners aged 30-55 making considered purchases for home improvement. We want to understand why customers add items to cart but do not complete purchase, and what interventions might increase conversion. We have access to funnel analytics, session recordings, and can implement exit surveys. Timeline is 6 weeks for research and recommendations. We have budget for A/B testing three interventions.

### Output

**Consumer Behavior Analysis: Cart Abandonment in Home Goods E-Commerce**

**Executive Summary**
Cart abandonment in high-consideration home goods purchases is driven by three primary psychological mechanisms: decision complexity overload (42%), price anxiety amplified by loss aversion (31%), and social proof gaps (27%). Recommended interventions targeting each mechanism can collectively recover 12-16% of abandoned carts, representing $1.2-1.6M in annual revenue recovery based on current traffic.

**Research Design**

| Method              | Purpose                     | Sample         | Timeline |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Funnel analytics    | Identify abandonment points | All sessions   | Week 1   |
| Session recordings  | Observe behavioral patterns | 200 sessions   | Week 2   |
| Exit surveys        | Capture stated reasons      | 500 abandoners | Week 2-3 |
| Behavioral analysis | Reconcile stated vs. actual | Combined       | Week 4   |
| Intervention design | Develop testable solutions  | -              | Week 5   |
| A/B test plan       | Prioritize experiments      | -              | Week 6   |

**Consumer Journey Map: Consideration to Cart Abandonment**

```
Awareness → Research → Comparison → Cart → Checkout → Abandonment
              ↓           ↓           ↓        ↓
          [8 min avg] [5+ tabs] [1.3 items] [Shipping reveal]
                         ↓                       ↓
                   [Comparison     [Loss aversion
                    paralysis]      triggered]
```

**Key Behavioral Findings**

**Finding 1: Decision Complexity Overload (42% of abandoners)**

_Observable behavior:_

- Session length: Average 12+ minutes with 5+ product page views
- Comparison patterns: Opening multiple tabs, returning to same products
- Cart behavior: Adding 2-3 similar items, then removing and abandoning

_Psychological mechanism:_
Decision complexity triggers choice paralysis (Iyengar & Lepper, 2000). When facing multiple similar options without clear differentiation criteria, consumers defer decision rather than risk "wrong" choice.

_Behavioral markers:_

- Time on site > 8 minutes before cart
- 5+ product pages in same category
- Multiple add/remove cycles
- Exit without viewing checkout

_Cognitive bias:_ Choice overload, status quo bias (deferral as safe default)

**Finding 2: Price Anxiety and Loss Aversion (31% of abandoners)**

_Observable behavior:_

- Checkout initiation: Begin checkout, reach shipping/total reveal
- Exit point: 68% abandon at shipping cost display
- Return rate: 23% return within 48 hours (price comparison completed)

_Psychological mechanism:_
Loss aversion (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) amplifies perceived "loss" of shipping costs. The unexpected additional cost at checkout triggers disproportionate negative response compared to economic magnitude.

_Stated reasons (exit survey):_

- "Wanted to compare prices first" (48%)
- "Shipping cost too high" (34%)
- "Need to think about it" (18%)

_Revealed behavior:_
Abandonment correlates more with shipping cost timing (surprise reveal) than shipping cost magnitude. $15 shipping shown late causes 2x abandonment of $25 shipping shown early.

_Cognitive biases:_ Loss aversion, anchoring (total seemed higher than expected)

**Finding 3: Social Proof Gap (27% of abandoners)**

_Observable behavior:_

- Review reading: 78% of abandoners viewed 0 reviews
- Product pages: Abandonment 2.3x higher on items with <10 reviews
- Session pattern: Product page → FAQ → Return policy → Exit

_Psychological mechanism:_
Uncertainty avoidance in high-consideration purchases. Unfamiliar brands or products without social validation trigger risk aversion.

_Behavioral markers:_

- First-time visitors (no prior purchase)
- Higher-priced items ($300+)
- Categories with complex features
- Extended time on return policy page

_Cognitive bias:_ Social proof heuristic, uncertainty aversion

**Behavioral Segmentation**

| Segment             | % of Abandoners | Primary Driver | Intervention Focus |
| ------------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Comparison Shoppers | 35%             | Complexity     | Decision support   |
| Price Sensitives    | 30%             | Loss aversion  | Early transparency |
| Risk Avoiders       | 25%             | Uncertainty    | Social proof       |
| Distracted Browsers | 10%             | Interruption   | Remarketing        |

**Intervention Recommendations**

**Priority 1: Comparison Simplification Tool (Expected: +5% recovery)**

_Behavioral target:_ Reduce cognitive load in decision-making

_Implementation:_

- "Compare top 3" feature limiting comparison to curated options
- Side-by-side comparison with clear differentiation criteria
- "Most popular choice" indicator based on purchase data

_Psychological principle:_ Choice architecture (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008)

- Reduce options to manageable set
- Provide decision criteria framework
- Social proof through popularity signals

_Test design:_

- Control: Current experience
- Variant A: Comparison limiter (max 3)
- Variant B: Comparison limiter + "most popular" badge
- Metric: Cart-to-purchase conversion rate

**Priority 2: Early Price Transparency (Expected: +4% recovery)**

_Behavioral target:_ Eliminate loss aversion trigger at checkout

_Implementation:_

- Shipping cost estimate on product page (based on common zones)
- Running cart total with shipping visible throughout
- Free shipping threshold progress indicator

_Psychological principle:_ Eliminate negative surprise, anchor on total price early

_Test design:_

- Control: Shipping revealed at checkout
- Variant A: Shipping estimate on product page
- Variant B: Shipping + free shipping progress bar
- Metric: Checkout completion rate

**Priority 3: Social Proof Enhancement (Expected: +3% recovery)**

_Behavioral target:_ Reduce perceived risk for unfamiliar products

_Implementation:_

- "X people viewing now" real-time indicator
- Recent purchase notifications ("Sarah in Portland just bought...")
- Review request automation for products with <10 reviews

_Psychological principle:_ Social proof reduces uncertainty in unfamiliar decisions

_Test design:_

- Control: Current review display
- Variant A: Real-time viewing indicator
- Variant B: Recent purchase notifications
- Metric: Conversion rate on low-review products

**A/B Testing Framework**

| Test               | Traffic Allocation | Duration | Primary Metric          | Success Threshold |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | -------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Comparison tool    | 20%                | 4 weeks  | Cart conversion         | +3%               |
| Price transparency | 20%                | 4 weeks  | Checkout completion     | +2.5%             |
| Social proof       | 20%                | 4 weeks  | Product page conversion | +2%               |

**Expected Impact Summary**

| Intervention                | Recovery Rate | Annual Revenue Impact |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Comparison simplification   | +5%           | $500K                 |
| Price transparency          | +4%           | $400K                 |
| Social proof                | +3%           | $300K                 |
| **Combined (non-additive)** | **+10-12%**   | **$1.0-1.2M**         |

**Ethical Considerations**
All interventions designed to reduce friction and support consumer decision-making, not manipulate. Transparency interventions (pricing) directly benefit consumer welfare. Social proof based on accurate data only.
