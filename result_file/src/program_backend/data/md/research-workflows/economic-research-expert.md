## Example Usage

### Input

We need to assess the employment effects of a proposed $15 minimum wage increase in our state. The current minimum wage is $10.50 and the proposal phases in over 3 years. The legislature wants to understand likely employment impacts, particularly for low-wage workers and small businesses, before voting on the bill. We have access to state employment data, Current Population Survey data for our region, and can analyze border county comparisons with neighboring states. The analysis will be presented in committee hearings and must withstand scrutiny. Timeline is 8 weeks.

### Output

**Economic Impact Assessment: $15 Minimum Wage Proposal**

**Executive Summary**
This analysis estimates employment effects of raising the minimum wage from $10.50 to $15.00 (43% increase) using difference-in-differences methodology exploiting border county variation. Based on the research design and meta-analytic evidence, we project employment elasticities of -0.02 to -0.05 for directly affected workers, implying 0.5-1.2% reduction in low-wage employment over the phase-in period. Effects concentrate in restaurants and retail, with larger impacts for teenage workers. Wage gains for retained workers substantially exceed aggregate employment losses, though distributional effects merit policy attention.

**Research Question and Theoretical Framework**

_Primary Question:_ What is the causal effect of the proposed minimum wage increase on employment levels in low-wage sectors?

_Secondary Questions:_

- How do effects vary by industry (restaurant, retail, manufacturing)?
- What is the differential impact on teenage vs. adult workers?
- How do small businesses respond differently than large employers?

_Theoretical Framework:_
Standard competitive labor market theory predicts employment reductions from minimum wage increases above market-clearing levels. However, monopsony models and dynamic frameworks suggest smaller (or zero) effects when employers have wage-setting power or when higher wages reduce turnover costs.

**Identification Strategy**

_Research Design:_ Difference-in-differences using contiguous border county pairs

_Treatment:_ Counties in our state (proposed $15 minimum wage)
_Control:_ Adjacent counties in neighboring states (current federal minimum or lower state rates)

_Identifying Assumption:_ Absent treatment, employment trends in border county pairs would be parallel (supported by pre-treatment trend analysis)

_Advantages of Design:_

- Controls for regional economic conditions affecting both sides of border
- Isolates minimum wage variation from confounding state policies
- Addresses selection into high/low minimum wage states

_Threats to Validity:_

- Spillover effects if workers cross borders (bias toward zero)
- Anticipatory effects if employers adjust before implementation
- General equilibrium effects in integrated labor markets

_Mitigation Strategies:_

- Event study to verify parallel pre-trends
- Include border-pair fixed effects
- Test for pre-treatment divergence
- Robustness using synthetic control

| Parameter                            | Point Estimate | 95% CI         | Basis           |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Employment elasticity (all low-wage) | -0.035         | [-0.05, -0.02] | Meta-analysis   |
| Restaurant sector elasticity         | -0.045         | [-0.08, -0.01] | Sector-specific |
| Retail sector elasticity             | -0.030         | [-0.06, 0.00]  | Sector-specific |
| Teenage worker elasticity            | -0.08          | [-0.15, -0.01] | Demographic     |

_Projected State Employment Effects:_

| Metric                             | Estimate        | Range      |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Low-wage workers directly affected | 285,000         | -          |
| Projected employment reduction     | 4,000-12,000    | (1.4-4.2%) |
| Workers receiving wage increase    | 270,000-280,000 | -          |
| Aggregate annual wage gains        | $380-420M       | -          |
| Aggregate annual employment cost   | $80-240M        | -          |

**Robustness Checks Required**

| Test                 | Purpose                   | Expected Finding            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Pre-trends analysis  | Verify parallel trends    | No pre-treatment divergence |
| Leave-one-out        | Check outlier sensitivity | Stable estimates            |
| Alternate clustering | Standard error robustness | Similar significance        |
| Triple-difference    | Within-county control     | Comparable magnitude        |
| Synthetic control    | State-level robustness    | Similar direction/size      |

**Distributional Analysis**

_Winners:_

- Low-wage workers who retain employment: +$4,500/year average
- Secondary earners in middle-income households: Majority of beneficiaries

_Potential Losers:_

- Workers who lose employment or hours: Concentrated among youngest, least skilled
- Small business owners: Margin compression
- Consumers: Modest price increases (est. 2-4% in affected sectors)

**Limitations and Uncertainty**

_Acknowledged Limitations:_

- Historical analysis may not predict effects of larger increases (43% vs. typical 10-15%)
- Regional economic conditions affect generalizability
- Phase-in dynamics differ from one-time increases
- Small business data limited

_Confidence Assessment:_

- Direction of effect: High confidence (negative employment effect)
- Magnitude: Medium confidence (wide range due to unprecedented size)
- Sectoral distribution: Medium-high confidence (restaurant/retail concentration)
- Timing: Lower confidence (phase-in dynamics uncertain)

**Policy Implications**

_Key Findings for Legislative Consideration:_

1. Employment effects likely negative but small relative to wage gains
2. Net economic impact positive for low-wage workers as a group
3. Teenage and restaurant workers face largest displacement risk
4. Phase-in provides adjustment time for employers

_Policy Design Recommendations:_

- Maintain 3-year phase-in to allow adjustment
- Consider subminimum training wage for teenagers (mitigates youth effects)
- Small business tax credit to ease transition (reduces displacement)
- Monitoring framework to assess actual versus predicted effects

_Caveats:_

- Economic forecasting inherently uncertain
- Effects may differ from historical patterns due to magnitude
- Local labor market conditions affect outcomes
