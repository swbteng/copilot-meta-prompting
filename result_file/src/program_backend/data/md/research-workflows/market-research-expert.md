**Key Consumer Insights**

**Purchase Drivers (Ranked by MaxDiff analysis):**

1. Taste/flavor quality (utility score: 42)
2. Protein content (utility score: 28)
3. Clean ingredient list (utility score: 24)
4. Price per serving (utility score: 19)
5. Brand recognition (utility score: 12)

**Critical Finding**: Taste is table stakes - 73% of survey respondents reported abandoning plant-based snacks that didn't meet taste expectations, regardless of health benefits. Repeat purchase correlates strongly with taste satisfaction (r = 0.71).

**Differentiation Opportunity**: "Indulgent health" positioning is underserved. Current products polarize between virtuous-but-boring and tasty-but-guilty. Combining craveable flavor profiles with transparent health credentials represents white space.
