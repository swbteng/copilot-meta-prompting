## Example Usage

### Input

"We need to choose a container orchestration platform for our microservices migration. Currently evaluating Kubernetes (self-managed on our existing VMware infrastructure), Amazon EKS, and Azure AKS. We have 50 microservices to migrate, a 10-person DevOps team with mixed experience, and multi-cloud is a consideration for the future. Budget is $500K first year including migration costs. Timeline is 6 months to production for initial services."

### Output

**Technology Assessment: Container Orchestration Platform Selection**

**Executive Summary**

**Recommendation**: Amazon EKS

EKS provides optimal balance of multi-cloud portability (Kubernetes standard), operational efficiency (managed control plane), and organizational fit (existing AWS skills on team). While Azure AKS shows marginally lower TCO, the team's AWS experience and multi-cloud flexibility requirement favor EKS. Self-managed Kubernetes is not recommended given team capacity constraints.

**Feasibility Assessment**

**Self-Managed Kubernetes on VMware**

- **Implementation Complexity**: High
  - Requires dedicated platform engineering team (3-4 FTE minimum)
  - Control plane HA, etcd management, upgrade procedures all manual
  - Integration with existing VMware networking adds complexity
- **Timeline**: 6-9 months to production readiness
- **Risk Level**: High - operational risk without deep K8s expertise in-house
- **Team Fit Assessment**: Current team of 10 would be stretched thin; 50% of capacity consumed by platform operations
- **Verdict**: Not recommended given resource constraints

**Amazon EKS**

- **Implementation Complexity**: Medium
  - Managed control plane eliminates ~40% of operational burden
  - VPC networking well-documented, but requires planning
  - Existing AWS experience (5 team members) accelerates adoption
- **Timeline**: 3-4 months to production readiness
- **Risk Level**: Moderate - well-documented, large community
- **Team Fit Assessment**: 5 engineers have AWS production experience; 2-3 week ramp-up estimated
- **Verdict**: Recommended - balances capability with feasibility

**Azure AKS**

- **Implementation Complexity**: Medium
  - Similar managed model to EKS
  - AKS-specific networking (Azure CNI) requires learning
  - Limited existing Azure skills (2 team members)
- **Timeline**: 4-5 months to production readiness (additional ramp-up)
- **Risk Level**: Moderate - smaller team knowledge base increases risk
- **Team Fit Assessment**: Significant training investment required (6+ weeks)
- **Verdict**: Viable but higher adoption risk

| Migration project                 | $150K                         | $100K                        | $120K            |
| Tooling & add-ons                 | $60K                          | $40K                         | $45K             |
| **3-Year Total**                  | **$1.16M**                    | **$896K**                    | **$870K**        |

**Assumptions**:

- 50 microservices, 3 environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Average 200 pods in production, 150 in non-prod
- DevOps engineer fully-loaded cost: $120K/year
- Infrastructure based on m5.xlarge equivalent instances

**Sensitivity Analysis**: EKS becomes lowest-cost option if team training costs exceed $60K for AKS, or if additional hiring required for self-managed.

**Risk Assessment**

| Risk              | Self-Managed | EKS    | AKS    | Mitigation                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Skill gap         | High         | Low    | Medium | Training program, certification paths      |
| Vendor lock-in    | None         | Medium | Medium | Terraform abstraction, K8s-native services |
| Migration failure | High         | Medium | Medium | Phased migration, rollback procedures      |
| Cost overrun      | High         | Low    | Low    | Reserved capacity, monitoring              |

---

**Recommendation: Amazon EKS**

**Primary Rationale**:

1. **Team Readiness**: Existing AWS skills reduce adoption risk and timeline
2. **Multi-Cloud Optionality**: Kubernetes workloads portable to other platforms if needed
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Managed control plane right-sizes for 10-person team
4. **TCO**: Competitive with AKS while reducing skill gap risk

**Dissenting Consideration**: AKS shows ~3% lower 3-year TCO. If Azure strategic relationship exists or planned, AKS warrants reconsideration.

**Implementation Roadmap**:

1. **Month 1-2**: Pilot migration (5 non-critical services), establish CI/CD patterns
2. **Month 2-3**: Production foundation (networking, security, monitoring)
3. **Month 3-5**: Wave-based migration (15 services per wave)
4. **Month 5-6**: Optimization, runbook development, training completion
