## Example Usage

### Input

"Considering entry into Asian markets. $20M investment required. We're a US SaaS company with $50M ARR. Board wants recommendation in 6 weeks."

### Output

**Executive Decision Analysis: Asia Market Entry**

**1. Decision Frame**
Core question: Should we invest $20M to enter Asian markets, and if so, how?

Success criteria (weighted):

- Revenue potential (30%): Achieve $5M ARR from Asia within 3 years
- Strategic positioning (25%): Establish presence before competitors
- Risk management (25%): Limited downside to core business
- Organizational capability (20%): Build without distracting from US growth

Decision type: Significant but partially reversible (can exit, though with sunk costs)

Key unknowns:

- Product-market fit in Asian contexts (localization needs)
- Go-to-market effectiveness (direct vs. partner)
- Competitive response from local players

**2. Options Analysis**
Option A: Full market entry (Recommended)

- Investment: $20M over 24 months
- Approach: Establish Singapore hub, hire regional leadership, localize product
- Pros: Maximum upside, competitive positioning, talent access
- Cons: Highest risk, management bandwidth, execution complexity
- Expected outcome: $5-8M ARR in 3 years if successful

Option B: Partnership-first

- Investment: $5M (partner enablement, light localization)
- Approach: Sign 2-3 regional partners, let them sell and support
- Pros: Lower risk, faster to market, leverages local expertise
- Cons: Lower margins, less control, dependent on partner quality
- Expected outcome: $2-3M ARR in 3 years

Option C: Acquisition

- Investment: $15-30M (depends on target)
- Approach: Acquire small Asian SaaS company with customers and team
- Pros: Instant presence, proven team, customer base
- Cons: Integration risk, valuation uncertainty, cultural challenges
- Expected outcome: Variable, depends on target

Option D: Wait and learn

- Investment: $500K (market research, pilot customers)
- Approach: Land 10-20 customers organically, learn before committing
- Pros: Lowest risk, learn before investing
- Cons: Competitors may establish position, slower growth
- Expected outcome: Decision quality improves, timeline extends

**3. Risk Assessment**
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Product-market fit issues | Medium | High | Pilot before full localization |
| Hiring challenges | Medium | Medium | Use recruitment partners, competitive comp |
| Competitive response | High | Medium | Move quickly, focus on differentiation |
| Currency/regulatory | Low | Medium | Legal/finance review, structure appropriately |
| Core business distraction | Medium | High | Dedicated team, clear boundaries |

Red flag indicators (exit triggers):

- Less than 50 qualified opportunities in pipeline by month 12
- Customer acquisition cost 3x US benchmark
- Core business growth slows more than 10%

**4. Implementation Plan (if Option A)**
Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Foundation

- Hire regional GM (critical success factor)
- Establish Singapore entity
- Begin product localization assessment
- Sign 5 pilot customers for validation

Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Build

- Build team to 15 people
- Complete priority localization
- Launch marketing, generate pipeline
- Target: 50 opportunities, 10 closed deals

Phase 3 (Months 13-24): Scale

- Expand team to 30 people
- Add second market (Japan or Australia)
- Target: $2M ARR, clear path to $5M

Go/no-go checkpoints:

- Month 6: GM hired, pilot customers engaged → Continue or exit
- Month 12: Pipeline and early wins validate approach → Continue or pivot
- Month 18: Unit economics prove out → Scale or contain

**5. Decision Record**
Board presentation summary:

- Recommendation: Option A (Full market entry) with milestone-based investment
- Investment: $7M in Year 1, $13M in Year 2 contingent on Year 1 milestones
- Expected return: $5-8M ARR by Year 3, strategic positioning for $100M+ long-term
- Key risk: Execution, mitigated by staged investment and clear exit triggers
- Decision needed: Approval of Year 1 investment and regional GM hire

Dissenting view to consider:

- "We should achieve 30%+ growth in US before distraction" - Valid, address by ensuring dedicated team with limited core overlap
