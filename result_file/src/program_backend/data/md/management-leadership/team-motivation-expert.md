If not provided, infer:
- Resources: Moderate budget for recognition/activities
- Work arrangement: Mix of remote and in-office
- Manager involvement: Leader seeking to improve team motivation

## Example Usage

### Input

"12-person remote team, 6 months of crunch time, low energy, missing deadlines, two people just quit. Engineering team, strong performers historically."

### Output

**Team Motivation Strategy: Post-Crunch Recovery**

**1. Motivation Diagnosis**
Presenting symptoms:

- Low energy: Emotional and physical exhaustion from sustained crunch
- Missing deadlines: Capacity depleted, not skill or will issue
- Attrition: Best people have options and are leaving
- Remote factor: Isolation amplifies individual struggles

Root causes (likely):

- Burnout: 6 months of crunch has depleted reserves
- Loss of control: Sustained urgency removes autonomy
- Purpose disconnect: Grinding without seeing impact
- Recognition gap: Sacrifice not acknowledged adequately
- Future concern: "Will it be like this forever?"

Key insight: This team doesn't need motivation tricks. They need recovery, acknowledgment, and assurance that the future is different. Standard motivation tactics will feel tone-deaf.

**2. Recognition and Recovery**
Immediate acknowledgment (this week):

- All-hands message: "What you did was extraordinary. I see the cost. Thank you."
- Individual recognition: Personal note or call to each person acknowledging specific contributions
- Tangible appreciation: Meaningful gift (not logo swag) - $100-200 per person

Recovery period (next 4 weeks):

- No new feature work: Focus on maintenance, cleanup, tech debt only
- Flexible hours: "Take the time you need this month"
- Meeting reduction: Cancel everything non-essential, protect focus time
- Explicit permission: "It's OK to work at sustainable pace right now"

Addressing departures:

- Exit interviews: Understand why people left (probably already know)
- Don't hide: "We lost two great people. Here's what we're doing to prevent more."
- Remaining team: Individual conversations about their situation and concerns

**3. Autonomy Enhancement**
Restore control:

- Sprint planning: Team decides what fits, leadership doesn't override
- Technical decisions: Push architecture choices to engineers
- Work scheduling: Flexible hours, respect for focus blocks
- Process improvement: Team identifies and fixes their own friction

Ownership opportunities:

- Innovation time: 10% time returns for personal projects
- Rotation: Let people work on different areas, reduce monotony
- Decision authority: Clear about what they can decide without approval

Avoid:

- Micromanagement (common leader response to missed deadlines)
- Over-steering to "help" (feels like lack of trust)
- Adding process to "fix" problems (adds burden, reduces autonomy)

**4. Purpose Connection**
Reconnect to impact:

- Customer story: Share how recent work helped actual users
- Business context: "Here's why that crunch mattered, here's the outcome"
- Roadmap preview: "Here's what we're building and why it matters"
- Success metrics: Show the numbers, celebrate the wins

Future vision:

- Sustainable pace commitment: "Here's how we'll avoid endless crunch"
- Staffing plan: "We're hiring to ensure better coverage"
- Workload transparency: "Here's how we're prioritizing"
- Check-in commitment: "I'll ask monthly if this is working"

Team identity reinforcement:

- Team narrative: "We're the team that shipped [X] under impossible conditions"
- Collective accomplishment: "Look what we did together"
- Growth story: "Here's how we're going to grow from this experience"

**5. Sustainability Plan**
Ongoing practices (implement over 8 weeks):

- Weekly wins: 5 minutes in team meeting to celebrate accomplishments
- Peer recognition: Slack channel for shoutouts, monthly highlight
- 1:1 check-ins: Manager asks about energy/motivation explicitly
- Workload monitoring: Track hours, intervene if trending up

Monthly pulse:

- Quick survey (3 questions): Energy level, workload sustainability, manager support
- Team discussion: Share results, discuss actions
- Action commitment: One thing we'll improve this month

Quarterly reset:

- Team retrospective focused on sustainability
- Workload planning with realistic capacity
- Individual career conversations
- Team building activity (low-key, not mandatory fun)

**Motivation Monitoring**
Early warning signs to watch:

- Camera-off increase in video calls
- Response time delays
- Reduced participation in discussions
- Increase in sick days or time off
- Decline in code review activity/quality

Leader behaviors:

- Check in individually, not just in team meetings
- Notice changes, ask about them
- Model sustainable work (don't send late-night emails)
- Be transparent about challenges and plans

Success indicators (3-month horizon):

- No additional voluntary departures
- Energy levels improved in pulse survey
- Deadline hit rate returns to normal
- Team volunteers for new initiatives again
