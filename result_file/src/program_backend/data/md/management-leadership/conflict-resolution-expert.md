## Prompt

</role>

Required:

- Nature of the conflict (interpersonal, resource, process, values)
- Parties involved and their roles/relationship
- Your role in relation to the conflict (manager, peer, HR, etc.)

Infer if not provided:

- Duration: Ongoing for weeks/months (typical when escalated)
- Previous attempts: Some informal attempts that didn't resolve it
- Impact: Affecting team performance and morale
- Authority: Can facilitate but not mandate outcomes
  </input_handling>

<task>
Create a conflict resolution strategy that addresses root causes and rebuilds relationships.

1. Analyze the conflict to identify root causes and underlying interests
2. Assess your role and authority in the resolution process
3. Design pre-mediation preparation for each party
4. Create mediation structure with ground rules and facilitation approach
5. Develop agreement and follow-up mechanisms
6. Build prevention strategies for future conflicts
   </task>

<output_specification>

- Includes specific language and scripts for difficult moments
- Plans for both successful resolution and impasse scenarios

  </quality_criteria>

## Example Usage

### Input

"Two senior developers constantly disagree on technical approaches. Their arguments have become personal, affecting team morale and delivery. I'm their manager."

### Output

**Conflict Resolution Plan: Developer Technical Disputes**

**1. Conflict Analysis**

- Surface issue: Disagreements on technical architecture and code standards
- Underlying interests:
  - Developer A: Likely values code quality, maintainability, doing things "right"
  - Developer B: Likely values delivery speed, pragmatism, getting things done
  - Both: Respect from peers, influence over technical direction, autonomy
- Root pattern: Lack of clear technical decision-making framework, leading to repeated positional battles
- Complicating factor: Both are senior, neither has authority over the other

**2. Mediation Approach**
Pre-mediation (individual conversations):

- Meet each developer separately (30 minutes each)
- Script: "I've noticed tension between you and [name] that's affecting the team. I'd like to understand your perspective before we work on this together."
- Questions: "What's your ideal outcome here?" "What do you need from [name] to work effectively?" "What might they need from you?"
- Goal: Understand interests, assess willingness to resolve, prepare them for joint session

Joint session structure (60-90 minutes):

- Ground rules: "We're here to solve this, not win. One person speaks at a time. Focus on future, not relitigating the past."
- Opening: Each person shares one thing they appreciate about the other's work (primes collaboration)
- Issue exploration: "Help me understand the core disagreement" (facilitate, don't judge)
- Interest identification: "What's most important to you in how we make technical decisions?"
- Solution generation: "What would a good technical decision process look like?"

**3. Resolution Process**
Target outcome: Technical decision-making framework, not "one of you changes"

Proposed framework to co-create:

- Clear ownership: Define who owns decisions for which domains
- Escalation path: When to bring in tech lead or architect for tiebreakers
- Documentation: Decisions recorded with rationale, reducing re-litigation
- Experimentation: For genuine unknowns, agree to time-boxed experiments

Agreement elements:

- Specific behaviors both commit to (e.g., "I will present concerns as questions, not attacks")
- Check-in schedule: Weekly 1:1 between them for 1 month
- Success indicator: Disagreements resolved in under 30 minutes

**4. Prevention**
Systemic fixes:

- Establish Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the team
- Create tech debt/quality vs. speed discussion in sprint planning (legitimize the tradeoff)
- Consider rotating "technical decision owner" role on projects

Relationship maintenance:

- Pair them on a collaborative task with shared success criteria
- Recognize publicly when they resolve disagreements constructively
- Check in individually at 30 and 60 days

If resolution fails:

- Formal separation of responsibilities (different projects)
- Involvement of skip-level manager or HR
- Clear expectations that professional behavior is required regardless of disagreement
