## Example Usage

### Input

"Goals: $20K house down payment in 18 months, pay off $5K student loans in 12 months, build retirement savings. Income $4,500/month, expenses $2,800. Currently have $12K saved and $8K emergency fund."

### Output

**Financial Goal Framework**

**Goal Definitions (SMART Format)**

_Goal 1: House Down Payment_

- Specific: Save $20,000 for home down payment
- Measurable: Track monthly contributions and balance
- Achievable: $8,000 needed ($20K - $12K existing)
- Relevant: Housing is top priority
- Time-bound: 18 months
- Monthly Required: $445

_Goal 2: Student Loan Elimination_

- Specific: Pay off $5,000 student debt
- Measurable: Track balance reduction monthly
- Achievable: $417/month extra beyond minimum
- Relevant: Eliminates debt before mortgage
- Time-bound: 12 months
- Monthly Required: $417 extra (plus $200 minimum = $617 total)

_Goal 3: Retirement Acceleration_

- Specific: Maximize retirement contributions
- Measurable: Track contribution rate and balance
- Target: 15% of income ($675/month)
- Status: Current contribution unknown, add after debt payoff

**Monthly Allocation Strategy**

_Available Monthly_: $4,500 - $2,800 = $1,700

_Allocation Plan_
| Goal | Monthly | Priority | Status |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| Emergency fund maintenance | $0 | Maintained | $8K complete |
| Student loan payoff | $617 | 1 (12 mo) | Active |
| House down payment | $700 | 2 (18 mo) | Active |
| Buffer/flexibility | $383 | 3 | Available |

_Sequencing_

- Months 1-12: Split focus on debt and down payment
- Months 13-18: Redirect debt payment to down payment ($1,317/month)
- Month 19+: Redirect all to retirement ($1,700/month potential)

**Projected Outcomes**

_Student Loans_
| Month | Payment | Balance |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 0 | - | $5,000 |
| 6 | $617/mo | $2,300 |
| 12 | $617/mo | $0 (PAID!) |

_House Down Payment_
| Month | Added | Balance |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 0 | - | $12,000 |
| 6 | $700/mo | $16,200 |
| 12 | $700/mo | $20,400 |
| 18 | $1,317/mo | $28,300 |

_Better than expected_: Following this plan, you'll have $28K+ available at month 18, exceeding the $20K target by over $8K.

| Loans PAID OFF    | Month 12 | Weekend activity           |
| $15K down payment | Month 9  | Small treat                |
| $20K down payment | Month 12 | Celebrate milestone        |
| Goal achieved     | Month 18 | House hunting celebration! |

**Obstacle Management**

_Common Setbacks_

- Unexpected expense: Use buffer first, then emergency fund if needed
- Income disruption: Prioritize minimums, pause extra contributions
- Motivation drop: Review progress made, remember the "why"
- Lifestyle creep: Return to original allocation, delay upgrades

_If Goals Slip_

- Don't abandon plan entirely
- Adjust timeline rather than targets
- Increase contributions when possible
- Small progress beats no progress

**Accountability System**

_Internal_

- Monthly calendar reminder for reviews
- Progress photo documentation
- Written reflection on wins/challenges

_External (Optional)_

- Accountability partner check-ins
- Share milestones with supportive friends/family
- Online community for motivation

**Post-Goal Planning**

_After Debt Payoff (Month 13+)_

- Redirect $617 to down payment: Accelerates timeline
- Celebrate freedom from debt payments
- Don't inflate lifestyle with freed cash

_After House Purchase (Month 19+)_

- $1,700/month available for:
  - Retirement catch-up (max out accounts)
  - House maintenance fund
  - Next financial goal (car, travel, investment)

**Success Metrics**

- Track monthly: Hit savings allocation targets
- Track quarterly: On pace for goal timelines
