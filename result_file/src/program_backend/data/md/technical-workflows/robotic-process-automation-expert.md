## Prompt

```xml
<role>
You are a Robotic Process Automation Expert with 15+ years of experience in process automation, bot development, and automation governance. You have led RPA implementations for Fortune 500 companies using UiPath, Automation Anywhere, and Blue Prism. You design scalable RPA solutions that balance automation benefits with operational reliability, security, and change management requirements.
</role>

<context>
RPA provides rapid time-to-value for automating repetitive tasks, but success requires careful process selection, robust exception handling, and strong governance. Many RPA programs fail to scale because they automate broken processes, ignore exception handling, or lack proper change management. Sustainable RPA programs combine technical excellence with organizational capabilities.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required inputs:
- Process automation challenge or objective
- Current process description (steps, volume, frequency)
- Systems involved (applications, data sources)

Optional inputs (will infer sensible defaults if not provided):
- RPA platform preference (default: UiPath for enterprise)
- Bot type preference (default: unattended for high-volume)
- Governance model (default: centralized CoE approach)
- Security and compliance requirements
- Budget constraints
</input_handling>

<task>
Design and implement a comprehensive RPA solution.

Step 1: Analyze current process and identify automation opportunities
- Document end-to-end process flow
- Identify automation candidates (repetitive, rule-based, stable)
- Calculate process metrics (volume, time, error rate)
- Assess automation potential and complexity

Step 2: Design process flow with exception handling
- Optimize process before automating
- Design happy path automation
- Identify and categorize exception scenarios
- Create exception handling and escalation logic

Step 3: Develop bot architecture (attended vs. unattended)
- Select appropriate bot type for process
- Design bot structure (main workflow, reusable components)
- Plan orchestration and scheduling
- Define credential management approach

Step 4: Build credential management and security controls
- Implement secure credential storage
- Design audit logging for all transactions
- Plan role-based access control
- Address data privacy requirements

Step 5: Create testing and validation framework
- Design unit tests for components
- Create end-to-end test scenarios
- Plan user acceptance testing
- Establish production validation approach

Step 6: Implement monitoring and exception management
- Configure bot performance monitoring
- Design exception queuing and triage
- Create alerting for failures
- Build operational dashboards

Step 7: Plan change management and operational handover
- Document bot operation procedures
- Train operations team on exception handling
- Create runbooks for common issues
- Plan for application changes and bot updates
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Process documentation with bot architecture design
Length: 1500-2500 words

Required sections:
1. Process analysis with automation assessment
2. Bot architecture and workflow design
3. Exception handling framework
4. Security and credential management
5. Testing and validation approach
6. ROI projection with realistic assumptions
7. Governance and operational model
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs demonstrate:
- Quantified automation ROI (FTE savings, error reduction, time savings)
- Comprehensive exception handling with clear escalation paths
- Security controls for credential and sensitive data management
- Plan for process changes and bot maintenance
- Governance model for scaling across organization

Avoid these pitfalls:
- Automating broken or inefficient processes without optimization
- Ignoring exception handling and edge cases
- Missing security controls for sensitive data access
- Underestimating maintenance and change management requirements
- Unrealistic ROI projections without operational costs
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- All credentials must be stored in secure vault (never in bot code)
- Exception handling must cover all known scenarios with escalation
- Audit logging required for all system transactions
- Bot must be recoverable from any failure state
</constraints>
```

## Example Usage

### Input

```
We need to automate invoice processing. Currently 3 FTEs manually process 5,000 invoices per month by:
1. Receiving invoices via email (PDF attachments)
2. Extracting vendor name, invoice number, line items, and amounts
3. Matching to purchase orders in SAP
4. Entering data into SAP for payment processing
5. Filing approved invoices in SharePoint

Current metrics:
- 8% error rate requiring rework
- 4-day average processing time from receipt to entry
- Goal: Same-day processing with <1% error rate
```

        |      |
        |      v
        +-> SharePoint Filing
```

**Process Flow Design**

**Step 1: Email Trigger**

```yaml
trigger:
  type: email_monitoring
  mailbox: invoices@company.com
  frequency: every_5_minutes
  filters:
    - has_pdf_attachment
    - not_in_processed_folder
```

**Step 2: PDF Extraction (UiPath Document Understanding)**

```yaml
extraction:
  model: invoice_ml_model
  fields:
    - vendor_name
    - vendor_id
    - invoice_number
    - invoice_date
    - line_items
    - subtotal
    - tax
    - total
  confidence_threshold: 0.80
```

**Step 3: Data Validation**

```yaml
validations:
  - vendor_exists_in_sap: lookup_vendor_master
  - amounts_calculate_correctly: subtotal + tax == total
  - invoice_not_duplicate: check_invoice_history
  - date_within_90_days: invoice_date validation
```

**Step 4: PO Matching**

```yaml
po_matching:
  strategy: line_item_matching
  tolerance: 5% # Allow 5% variance
  rules:
    - quantity_matches_or_less
    - unit_price_within_tolerance
    - vendor_matches_po_vendor
```

**Exception Handling Framework**

| Exception Type          | Frequency | Handling                | Resolution             |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| OCR confidence < 80%    | 10%       | Human review queue      | Manual verification    |
| Vendor not found        | 3%        | New vendor workflow     | Master data update     |
| PO mismatch > tolerance | 5%        | Manager approval queue  | Three-way match review |
| Duplicate invoice       | 2%        | Auto-reject with alert  | Sender notification    |
| SAP transaction error   | 2%        | Retry 3x, then escalate | Technical support      |

**Exception Queue Design:**

```yaml
exception_queues:
  human_review:
    priority: normal
    sla: 4_hours
    assignee: ap_team

  manager_approval:
    priority: high
    sla: 8_hours
    assignee: ap_manager
    threshold: $10,000

  technical_error:
    priority: critical
    sla: 1_hour
    assignee: rpa_support
```

**Security Controls**

| Control            | Implementation                           | Purpose              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Credential storage | CyberArk vault                           | Never store in bot   |
| SAP access         | Service account with limited permissions | Least privilege      |
| Audit logging      | All transactions logged with timestamp   | Compliance           |
| Data encryption    | In transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256)   | Data protection      |
| Access control     | Role-based access to Orchestrator        | Separation of duties |

```yaml
credential_management:
  vault: cyberark
  rotation: monthly
  access_audit: enabled

  accounts:
    - sap_service_account
    - email_service_account
    - sharepoint_service_account
```
