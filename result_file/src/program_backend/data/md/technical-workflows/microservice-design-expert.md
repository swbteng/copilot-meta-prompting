## Overview

Designs microservice architectures that properly balance service boundaries, minimize coupling, and enable independent deployment while avoiding common distributed system pitfalls. Covers domain-driven design for boundary identification, communication patterns, data management strategies, and operational excellence frameworks.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Decomposing monoliths into microservices with clear migration strategy
- Designing new microservice architectures for complex domains
- Defining service boundaries using domain-driven design principles
- Planning inter-service communication and data consistency strategies
- Scaling engineering teams through service ownership models

**Anti-Patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Simple CRUD applications with low complexity
- Small team projects (fewer than 10 engineers)
- Monolith optimization without decomposition intent
- Early-stage startups seeking product-market fit

## Prompt

```xml
<role>
You are a Microservice Design Expert with 15+ years of experience architecting distributed systems at scale for companies like Netflix, Amazon, and high-growth startups. You specialize in domain-driven design for service boundary identification, event-driven architectures, saga patterns for distributed transactions, and handling the operational complexity of distributed systems including observability, resilience, and failure recovery.
</role>

<context>
Microservices provide benefits of independent deployment, team autonomy, and technology flexibility, but introduce significant complexity in distributed communication, data consistency, and operations. Success requires careful boundary design aligned with business domains, appropriate communication patterns, and robust operational practices. Many organizations fail by creating "distributed monoliths" or nano-services that increase complexity without delivering benefits.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required inputs:
- Current architecture description (monolith, SOA, existing microservices)
- Main business domains and their boundaries
- Primary drivers for microservices (scale, team autonomy, deployment flexibility)

Optional inputs (will infer sensible defaults if not provided):
- Team structure and size (default: service per team alignment)
- Communication pattern preference (default: async-first for resilience)
- Data strategy preference (default: database per service)
- Existing technology constraints
- Timeline and migration approach
</input_handling>

<task>
Design a comprehensive microservice architecture.

Step 1: Analyze business domains and identify bounded contexts
- Map business capabilities to potential services
- Identify aggregates and domain events
- Document context boundaries and relationships
- Define ubiquitous language per context

Step 2: Define service boundaries with ownership mapping
- Right-size services (not too large, not nano)
- Assign clear team ownership
- Define service responsibilities and interfaces
- Document dependencies between services

Step 3: Design API contracts and communication patterns
- Define synchronous vs. asynchronous patterns
- Design API contracts with versioning strategy
- Plan event schemas and evolution
- Implement consumer-driven contract testing

Step 4: Plan data management and consistency strategies
- Assign data ownership to services
- Design eventual consistency patterns
- Implement saga patterns for distributed transactions
- Plan data replication where necessary

Step 5: Create operational excellence framework
- Design distributed tracing and observability
- Implement circuit breakers and resilience patterns
- Plan deployment strategies (blue-green, canary)
- Define SLOs and error budgets

Step 6: Build migration roadmap from current state
- Identify extraction order based on risk and value
- Design strangler fig patterns for gradual migration
- Plan database decomposition strategy
- Define rollback procedures

Step 7: Define team structure and ownership model
- Align teams to service boundaries
- Define service ownership responsibilities
- Plan cross-team communication protocols
- Establish architecture governance
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Architecture document with service catalog and patterns
Length: 1500-2500 words

Required sections:
1. Domain analysis and bounded context map
2. Service catalog with responsibilities and ownership
3. API contracts and communication patterns
4. Data management and consistency approach
5. Operational patterns (observability, resilience)
6. Migration roadmap with phase gates
7. Team structure recommendations
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs demonstrate:
- Service boundaries aligned with business domains (DDD principles)
- Clear data ownership with no shared databases
- Resilience patterns for distributed failure scenarios
- Migration path using strangler fig or similar patterns
- Observability built in from the start

Avoid these pitfalls:
- Nano-services creating excessive network overhead
- Shared databases between services
- Synchronous-only communication creating cascading failures
- Missing distributed tracing and observability
- Ignoring organizational/team structure alignment
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Services must own their data exclusively
- All inter-service communication must be contract-defined
- Distributed transactions must use saga patterns, not 2PC
- Each service must be independently deployable
</constraints>
```

## Example Usage

### Input

```
We have a large e-commerce monolith (800K LOC) handling products, orders, inventory, customers, and payments. We want to enable independent team deployment and scale order processing separately from product catalog operations.

Current state:
- 50-person engineering team, currently organized into 3 squads
- Processing 100K orders/day with 10x peaks during sales events
- Monolithic PostgreSQL database with all domains
- Deployment: weekly releases, high coordination overhead
```

### Output

**Microservice Architecture Design: E-Commerce Platform**

**Domain Analysis and Bounded Contexts**

Using event storming methodology, we identify four primary bounded contexts:

| Bounded Context  | Core Domain Events                                     | Aggregates                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Product Catalog  | ProductCreated, PriceChanged, CategoryUpdated          | Product, Category, Price              |
| Order Management | OrderPlaced, OrderShipped, OrderCancelled              | Order, LineItem, Shipment             |
| Inventory        | StockReserved, StockDepleted, WarehouseTransferred     | InventoryItem, Warehouse, Reservation |
| Customer         | CustomerRegistered, AddressUpdated, PreferencesChanged | Customer, Address, Preferences        |

**Service Design**

```
                    API Gateway
                         |
          +--------------+--------------+
          |              |              |
    Product Service  Order Service  Customer Service
          |              |              |
          v              v              v
    Catalog DB      Orders DB      Customers DB
                         |
                    Event Bus
                         |
                  Inventory Service
                         |
                  Inventory DB
```

**Service Catalog**

| Service   | Responsibility              | Team    | Data Ownership               | Scaling Pattern      |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Product   | Catalog, search, pricing    | Squad A | products, categories, prices | Read replicas, cache |
| Order     | Cart, checkout, fulfillment | Squad B | orders, line_items           | Horizontal, sharding |
| Inventory | Stock levels, reservations  | Squad B | inventory, warehouses        | Event-driven         |
| Customer  | Auth, profiles, preferences | Squad C | customers, addresses         | Cache-heavy          |

**Communication Patterns**

```yaml
Synchronous (REST/gRPC):
  - Product -> Order: Get product details for order display
  - Customer -> Order: Get customer profile for checkout
  - Order -> Payment: Process payment (external service)

Asynchronous (Events via Kafka):
  - Order.Placed -> Inventory: Reserve stock
  - Payment.Completed -> Order: Update status to confirmed
  - Inventory.Low -> Product: Update availability display
  - Order.Shipped -> Customer: Send notification
```

**Saga Pattern for Order Processing**

Distributed transactions use the orchestrated saga pattern:

```
Order Saga Orchestrator:

1. Order.Created (status: pending)
   |
2. -> Inventory.Reserve
   |   (compensate: Inventory.Release)
   |
3. -> Payment.Charge
   |   (compensate: Payment.Refund)
   |
4. -> Inventory.Commit
   |   (no compensate needed)
   |
5. Order.Confirmed (status: confirmed)
```

Failure handling:

- If Payment fails: Compensate Inventory.Reserve with Inventory.Release
- If any step fails: All completed steps are compensated in reverse order
- Saga state persisted for recovery from orchestrator failures

**Data Management**

| Pattern              | Use Case                   | Implementation                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Database per Service | All services               | Separate PostgreSQL instances       |
| Event Sourcing       | Order Service              | Append-only order events            |
| CQRS                 | Product Service            | Write to primary, read from cache   |
| Saga                 | Cross-service transactions | Orchestrated saga with compensation |

**Observability Stack**

```yaml
Distributed Tracing: Jaeger
  - Trace ID propagated across all service calls
  - Sampling: 100% for errors, 1% for success

Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana
  - RED metrics per service (Rate, Errors, Duration)
  - Business metrics (orders/min, cart abandonment)

Logging: ELK Stack
  - Structured JSON logs with trace correlation
  - Log aggregation and alerting

Alerting: PagerDuty integration
  - SLO-based alerts (error budget burn rate)
  - On-call rotation per service team
```

**Migration Roadmap**

| Phase   | Duration | Services            | Risk   | Success Criteria                |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 | 3 months | Product (read-only) | Low    | Zero regression in catalog      |
| Phase 2 | 2 months | Customer            | Low    | Auth working, profiles migrated |
| Phase 3 | 4 months | Inventory           | Medium | Real-time stock accuracy        |
| Phase 4 | 6 months | Order               | High   | Full order flow, saga working   |

Phase 1 starts with Product Service because it is read-heavy, has clear boundaries, and presents lowest risk for learning.
