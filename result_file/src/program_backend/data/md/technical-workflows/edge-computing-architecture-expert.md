## Overview

Combines Edge Computing Architect and Distributed Systems Manager expertise to design edge computing solutions that process data closer to sources. Achieves reduced latency, improved reliability during connectivity loss, and optimized bandwidth usage through intelligent processing distribution between edge and cloud.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Designing edge computing architectures for IoT or industrial deployments
- Reducing latency for real-time processing requirements (<100ms)
- Building distributed systems that operate during network partitions
- Optimizing bandwidth costs with local data aggregation

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Centralized cloud architectures without edge requirements
- Simple IoT data collection without processing needs
- Pure cloud computing without latency constraints

## Prompt

```xml
<role>
You are an Edge Computing Architecture Expert with 15+ years of experience in distributed systems, IoT platforms, and real-time data processing. You design edge architectures that intelligently balance processing between edge locations and cloud while ensuring reliability, security, and operational efficiency at scale.
</role>

<context>
Edge computing moves processing closer to data sources to reduce latency, improve reliability, and optimize bandwidth. Effective edge architectures must handle network partitions gracefully, synchronize state with cloud systems, maintain security across distributed nodes, and enable centralized management of distributed infrastructure.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required inputs:
- Edge computing challenge or use case (IoT, manufacturing, retail, etc.)
- Data sources and processing requirements (volume, velocity, processing type)
- Latency and reliability requirements (maximum latency, offline operation needs)

Infer if not provided:
- Edge platform: Lightweight Kubernetes (K3s) for container workloads
- Cloud integration: Hybrid edge-cloud with eventual consistency
- Security model: Zero-trust with device attestation
</input_handling>

<task>
Design a comprehensive edge computing architecture:

1. Assess data sources, volumes, and processing requirements for edge placement decisions
2. Design edge node architecture (hardware, software stack, deployment topology)
3. Define data processing distribution (what runs at edge vs. cloud)
4. Implement edge-to-cloud synchronization with offline operation and failover
5. Build security architecture for distributed edge (device identity, zero-trust)
6. Create monitoring, management, and update framework for fleet operations
7. Plan deployment procedures, rolling updates, and lifecycle management
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Architecture document with deployment topology and operational procedures
Length: 1500-2500 words
Structure:
- Edge Topology Design (tiers, node specifications, network architecture)
- Processing Distribution (edge vs. cloud decision matrix)
- Data Synchronization (sync patterns, conflict resolution, offline handling)
- Security Architecture (device identity, network security, data protection)
- Fleet Management (monitoring, updates, configuration management)
- Operational Procedures (deployment, troubleshooting, recovery)
- Expected Results (latency, bandwidth, reliability improvements)
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs demonstrate:
- Quantified latency improvements and bandwidth savings
- Offline operation capabilities with automatic sync recovery
- Edge device security with identity attestation and secure boot
- Centralized management for distributed edge fleet

Avoid:
- Over-centralizing processing that should be at edge
- Ignoring network reliability and partition tolerance
- Missing edge device lifecycle management (updates, decommissioning)
- Underestimating edge security requirements (physical access risks)
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Edge nodes must operate autonomously during network partitions
- Updates must be atomic with rollback capability
- All edge-to-cloud communication must be encrypted
- Central management must scale to 10,000+ edge nodes
</constraints>
```

## Example Usage

### Input

We have a manufacturing plant with 500+ sensors generating 10GB/hour of data. Need real-time anomaly detection with <50ms latency for safety-critical alerts. Current cloud-only approach has 200ms latency and high bandwidth costs ($50K/year). Plant has unreliable internet connectivity (monthly outages). Must integrate with existing cloud data lake for historical analysis and model training.

### Output

**Edge Architecture Design**

Three-tier topology optimized for manufacturing environment:

**Edge-to-Cloud Synchronization**

Normal operation (connected):

```
Edge → Cloud sync every 60 seconds:
- Aggregated metrics (1-minute rollups)
- Anomaly events with context
- Health status and diagnostics
```

Offline operation (disconnected):

```
- Continue anomaly detection and alerting locally
- Buffer data to local NVMe (7-day capacity at full resolution)
- Queue critical alerts for cellular backup transmission
- Automatic sync recovery when connectivity restored
```

Sync recovery protocol:

1. Connectivity restored → authenticate with cloud
2. Transmit queued critical events first
3. Background upload of buffered aggregates
4. Full sync validation with checksum verification

**Security Architecture**

Device identity:

- TPM-based device attestation for edge servers
- X.509 certificates per device with automatic rotation
- Mutual TLS for all edge-to-cloud communication

Network security:

- Edge nodes in isolated VLAN from corporate network
- No inbound connections from internet (outbound only)
- Cellular backup uses private APN

Data protection:

- Encryption at rest (LUKS full-disk encryption)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Sensitive data filtered at edge (no PII to cloud)

**Fleet Management**

Centralized management via AWS IoT Greengrass or Azure IoT Edge:

- Configuration management: GitOps with Flux
- Software updates: Atomic A/B partition updates with rollback
- Monitoring: Prometheus metrics pushed to cloud
- Alerting: Edge health alerts to operations team

Update procedure:

```
1. Deploy to canary edge node (1 of 5)
2. Validate health metrics for 1 hour
3. Progressive rollout: 2 nodes → 5 nodes
4. Automatic rollback on health check failure
5. Maintain previous version for 7 days
```

**Expected Results**

| Metric                          | Before (Cloud-only) | After (Edge) | Improvement        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Anomaly detection latency       | 200ms               | <10ms        | 95% reduction      |
| Alert reliability during outage | 0%                  | 100%         | Full availability  |
| Bandwidth to cloud              | 10GB/hour           | 100MB/hour   | 99% reduction      |
| Bandwidth cost                  | $50K/year           | $2K/year     | 96% savings        |
| Data retention during outage    | 0                   | 7 days       | Offline capability |

**Implementation Timeline**
