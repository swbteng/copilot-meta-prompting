## Example Usage

### Input

"We're redesigning the account overview dashboard for our mobile banking app. Target users are millennials (25-40) who check their finances on mobile 3-5x per week. Main complaints: hard to see spending trends, too many taps to transfer money, and alerts are overwhelming."

### Output

**UX Design: Mobile Banking Dashboard Redesign**

**Primary Persona: Alex, 32**

- Goals: Quick balance check, understand spending patterns, move money easily
- Context: Checks app during commute, lunch break; wants 30-second interactions
- Pain points: Information overload, buried features, irrelevant notifications

**Design Principles**

1. Glanceable: Key information visible without interaction
2. Action-oriented: Common tasks within 2 taps
3. Personalized: Surface relevant insights, suppress noise

**Information Architecture**

_Dashboard Hierarchy_

1. Account summary (balance, recent change indicator)
2. Smart insights (AI-generated spending observation)
3. Quick actions (Transfer, Pay, Deposit)
4. Recent transactions (last 5, expandable)
5. Spending snapshot (current month vs. budget)

_Navigation_

- Bottom nav: Home, Transactions, Transfer, Cards, More
- Swipe between accounts on dashboard
- Pull to refresh

**Wireframe: Dashboard Screen**

```
[Header: Greeting + notification bell (dot indicator)]
[Account Card: Swipeable]
  - Account name, masked number
  - Current balance (large)
  - Change indicator: +$450 this week
[Insight Card]
  - "You've spent 20% less on dining this month"
  - [See Details] link
[Quick Actions Row]
  - [Transfer] [Pay] [Deposit] - icon + label
[Recent Activity]
  - 5 transactions, merchant + amount
  - [View All Transactions]
[Spending Snapshot]
  - Simple bar: $1,200 of $2,000 budget used
```

**Interaction Specifications**

_Quick Transfer Flow_

- Tap Transfer → Recent recipients shown first
- Select recipient → Amount input with quick amount buttons ($50, $100, $250)
- Review → Confirm with Face ID/PIN
- Total flow: 4 taps maximum for repeat transfers

_Smart Notification Settings_

- Onboarding: "What alerts matter to you?" (essential, balanced, all)
- Settings: Category toggles with frequency options
- Smart default: Large transactions, low balance, bill due

**Usability Test Plan**

- Scenario 1: "Check your balance and see how spending compares to last month" (target: <15 seconds)
- Scenario 2: "Transfer $100 to your friend who you paid last week" (target: <30 seconds, 4 taps)
- Scenario 3: "Find and adjust your notification preferences" (target: <45 seconds)
- Success metrics: Task completion rate >90%, SUS score >75, time-on-task reduction vs. current
