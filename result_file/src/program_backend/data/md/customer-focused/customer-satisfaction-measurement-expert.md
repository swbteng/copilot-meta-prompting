## Overview

Design comprehensive customer satisfaction measurement systems that provide actionable insights and drive improvement. This prompt helps organizations build multi-metric frameworks combining NPS, CSAT, CES, and custom metrics, with proper survey strategies, closed-loop response processes, and continuous improvement tracking. Focuses on creating measurement systems that inform decisions rather than just producing reports.

## When to Use

### Ideal Scenarios

- Implementing or redesigning customer satisfaction measurement programs
- Moving from ad-hoc surveys to systematic feedback collection
- Connecting satisfaction metrics to business outcomes (retention, revenue)
- Building closed-loop processes for acting on customer feedback
- Establishing benchmarks and improvement tracking frameworks
- Integrating satisfaction data into operational dashboards

### Anti-Patterns (When Not to Use)

- One-time feedback collection for specific initiative (use targeted survey)
- When organization has no capacity to act on feedback
- Purely compliance-driven measurement with no improvement intent
- When customer access is too limited for statistical validity
- Deep qualitative research needs (use interview-based research)

### Assistant Output

**EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW**

Your current annual NPS of 32 provides limited actionability due to infrequent collection and lack of touchpoint-specific insights. I recommend implementing a multi-metric system with continuous collection at key touchpoints, closed-loop processes for at-risk accounts, and driver analysis to inform product and operational decisions.

**MULTI-METRIC FRAMEWORK**

**Relationship Metrics (Account-Level Health):**

| Metric                | Purpose                  | Calculation                                         | Collection | Target |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| NPS                   | Loyalty and advocacy     | % Promoters minus % Detractors                      | Quarterly  | 50+    |
| Customer Health Score | Composite account health | Usage (40%) + Engagement (30%) + Satisfaction (30%) | Continuous | 80+    |

**Transactional Metrics (Touchpoint-Level):**

| Metric                      | Purpose                  | Calculation                                 | Collection       | Target      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| CSAT                        | Transaction satisfaction | Average rating (1-5 scale)                  | Post-interaction | 4.5+        |
| CES                         | Effort required          | Average effort score (1-5, lower is better) | After support    | 2.0 or less |
| Onboarding Completion Score | Onboarding success       | Weighted milestone completion               | Day 7, 30, 60    | 85%+        |

**Why This Combination:**

- NPS captures relationship strength and predicts retention
- CSAT measures immediate satisfaction after specific interactions
- CES identifies friction that causes churn even with satisfied customers
- Health Score provides continuous visibility without survey fatigue

**SURVEY STRATEGY BY TOUCHPOINT**

**Onboarding Journey:**
| Timing | Survey Type | Questions | Response Target |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Day 7 | Onboarding pulse | 3 questions: confidence, clarity, blockers | 60% |
| Day 30 | CSAT + Open | 4 questions: satisfaction, adoption, support quality | 50% |
| Day 60 | Onboarding NPS | NPS + "What would help you get more value?" | 45% |

**Support Interactions:**
| Timing | Survey Type | Questions | Response Target |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Immediate (after resolution) | CES + CSAT | 2 questions: effort, satisfaction | 35% |
| For escalations | Detailed follow-up | 5 questions: resolution, communication, outcome | 50% |

**Quarterly Business Reviews:**
| Timing | Survey Type | Questions | Response Target |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 24 hours after QBR | Relationship pulse | 3 questions: value, partnership, priorities | 60% |

**Renewal Milestone:**
| Timing | Survey Type | Questions | Response Target |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 60 days before renewal | NPS + Value assessment | 4 questions: NPS, value realization, concerns, advocacy | 55% |

---

**SURVEY DESIGN BEST PRACTICES**

**Question Design:**

- Use consistent rating scales across surveys (1-5 for CSAT, 0-10 for NPS)
- Place quantitative rating questions first, open-ended last
- Limit surveys to 3-5 questions maximum (every additional question reduces response by 5-10%)
- Include one open-ended question for context

**Delivery Optimization:**

- Send surveys from a recognizable person (CSM name), not generic address
- Mobile-optimize all surveys (40%+ of B2B opens are mobile)
- Include estimated completion time ("Takes 30 seconds")
- Send reminder once only, 48 hours after initial send

**Sample Questions:**

Onboarding Day 7:

1. "How confident are you in using [Product] for your daily work?" (1-5 scale)
2. "Was your onboarding experience clear and well-organized?" (1-5 scale)
3. "What's your biggest question or blocker right now?" (Open text)

Support CES:

1. "How easy was it to get your issue resolved?" (1-5 scale, 1=Very Easy)
2. "How satisfied are you with the support you received?" (1-5 scale)
3. "Anything else we should know?" (Optional open text)
