## Overview

Optimize customer support operations to deliver faster resolutions, higher satisfaction, and improved team efficiency. This prompt helps design tiered support models, ticket workflow optimization, knowledge management systems, agent enablement tools, and performance frameworks that balance cost-effectiveness with customer experience quality.

## When to Use

### Ideal Scenarios

- Redesigning support operations for scale or quality improvement
- Implementing or optimizing ticketing and routing systems
- Building knowledge bases and self-service capabilities
- Establishing support metrics frameworks and SLAs
- Training support teams on best practices
- Reducing support costs while maintaining or improving satisfaction

### Anti-Patterns (When Not to Use)

- Single complex escalation requiring immediate resolution
- Pure technical troubleshooting for specific issues
- When no authority exists to change support processes
- Call center voice operations (specialized domain)
- When support volume is too low to justify process investment

## Prompt

```xml
<role>
You are a Customer Support Process Expert with 15+ years of experience building and optimizing support operations at high-growth SaaS companies and enterprise organizations. You have scaled support teams from 5 to 500+ agents, implemented major support platforms (Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk, ServiceNow), and achieved top-quartile CSAT and efficiency metrics. You specialize in tiered support models, knowledge-centered service, and balancing automation with human touch.
</role>

<context>
Support operations face constant tension between cost efficiency and customer experience quality. The best support organizations resolve this through intelligent tiering, effective self-service, knowledge-driven support, and empowered agents who can resolve issues quickly. Process design must account for agent experience alongside customer experience, as burned-out agents cannot deliver great support.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required information to gather:
1. Support channels currently offered (email, chat, phone, social, in-app)
2. Team size and current structure
3. Current ticket volume and common issue types
4. Current ticket routing and prioritization approach
5. Tools and systems in use
6. Current resolution times and satisfaction scores
7. Main pain points for customers and agents
8. Specific metrics to improve
9. Upcoming changes or scaling needs
10. Budget and resource constraints

## Example Usage

### User Input

```
1. Channels: Email (60%), live chat (30%), in-app (10%)
2. Team: 10 support agents, 1 team lead, no specialists
3. Volume: 500 daily tickets; top issues are account access (25%), billing questions (20%), feature how-to (30%), bugs (15%), other (10%)
4. Routing: Currently all tickets go to shared queue, agents pick next available
5. Tools: Zendesk for ticketing, basic knowledge base (outdated), Slack for internal comms

6. Performance: Average first response 4 hours, average resolution 18 hours, CSAT 3.8/5
7. Pain points: Customers frustrated by slow response; agents overwhelmed, constantly context-switching; knowledge base unused
8. Goals: Reduce first response to under 1 hour, improve CSAT to 4.3+, reduce ticket volume by 25% through self-service
9. Changes: Launching new product tier in 3 months, expecting 30% volume increase
10. Constraints: No additional headcount approved this quarter, can invest in tools/training
```

### Assistant Output

**SUPPORT OPERATIONS ASSESSMENT**

Your current shared-queue model with generalist agents is creating inefficiency and burnout. With 500 daily tickets across 10 agents, each agent handles 50 tickets per day, which is at the high end of sustainable volume. The upcoming 30% increase will break this model. I recommend implementing a tiered structure with intelligent routing, self-service expansion, and knowledge-driven support to handle growth without additional headcount.

**TICKET WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION**

**Lifecycle Stages:**

| Stage            | Definition                 | SLA Target                | Automation                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| New              | Ticket created, unassigned | Classify within 5 min     | Auto-classify by keywords |
| First Response   | Agent acknowledged         | 1 hour (chat: 2 min)      | Auto-assign by tier/skill |
| In Progress      | Agent working resolution   | Updates every 4 hours     | Reminder automation       |
| Pending Customer | Waiting for customer reply | 24 hours before follow-up | Auto follow-up            |
| Pending Internal | Waiting for internal team  | Tracked separately        | Escalation alerts         |
| Resolved         | Solution provided          | Customer confirms or 48h  | Auto-close after 48h      |
| Closed           | Complete                   | N/A                       | CSAT survey triggered     |

**Routing Logic:**

```
IF ticket contains "password" OR "login" OR "access" THEN
  → Auto-suggest KB article, if customer continues → Tier 1

IF ticket contains "billing" OR "invoice" OR "charge" THEN
  → Route to Tier 1 billing-tagged agent

IF ticket contains "bug" OR "error" OR "broken" THEN
  → Route to Tier 2 immediately

IF customer tier = "Enterprise" OR "VIP" THEN
  → Route to Tier 2, alert Team Lead

IF sentiment = "Angry" (detected by keywords) THEN
  → Route to experienced agent, flag for priority

DEFAULT → Tier 1 shared queue, round-robin assignment
```

**Priority Matrix:**

| Priority | Criteria                            | First Response SLA | Resolution SLA |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| Urgent   | Account locked, payment failed, VIP | 15 minutes         | 4 hours        |
| High     | Feature broken, billing discrepancy | 1 hour             | 8 hours        |
| Normal   | How-to questions, general inquiries | 4 hours            | 24 hours       |
| Low      | Feature requests, feedback          | 8 hours            | 72 hours       |
