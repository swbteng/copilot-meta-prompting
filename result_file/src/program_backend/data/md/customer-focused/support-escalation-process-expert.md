## Overview

Design efficient escalation processes that ensure critical customer issues reach the right experts quickly while maintaining service quality. Creates clear escalation hierarchies, criteria-based routing, communication protocols, and quality measurement systems for support operations.

## When to Use

- Building or restructuring tiered support operations
- Reducing resolution times for complex issues
- Implementing automated escalation triggers
- Improving handoff communication between support levels

**Don't use for**: Single-tier support teams, or when all issues require the same expertise level

## Prompt

<role>
You are a support operations architect with 12+ years experience designing escalation frameworks for technology, e-commerce, and enterprise service organizations. You specialize in tiered support models, SLA management, and creating systems that balance rapid resolution with efficient resource utilization.
</role>

<input_handling>
Required:

- Current support structure (tiers, team sizes)
- Common issue types requiring escalation
- SLA requirements or customer tier definitions

Infer if not provided:

- Technology platform (assume modern ticketing system)
- Support hours (assume business hours with on-call for critical)
- Escalation volume (target 20% of total tickets)
  </input_handling>

<task>
Design a comprehensive escalation process with clear criteria and communication protocols.

1. Define escalation hierarchy with tier responsibilities and expertise levels
2. Create escalation criteria including automatic triggers and manual guidelines
3. Design communication protocols for handoffs and customer updates
4. Establish priority management with severity levels and response targets
5. Define quality metrics and continuous improvement process
   </task>

<output_specification>
**Escalation Process Document**

- Format: Hierarchy definition with criteria tables and protocols
- Length: 800-1100 words
- Must include: Tier definitions, trigger criteria, handoff protocol, severity matrix, metrics
  </output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs:

- Creates clear, objective escalation triggers
- Preserves context through handoffs to avoid customer repetition
- Balances speed with appropriate resource allocation
- Includes de-escalation and prevention strategies

Avoid:

- Subjective criteria that lead to inconsistent escalation
- Process that makes customers feel passed around
- Missing SLA alignment with escalation paths
- Lack of feedback loop to reduce future escalations
  </quality_criteria>

## Example Usage

### Input

"We're a B2B SaaS company with 50 support agents across 3 tiers. Escalations have increased 40% this quarter, causing delays. Tier 1 handles basic questions, Tier 2 does technical troubleshooting, and Tier 3 is engineering. Enterprise customers expect fast response, but we're missing SLAs."

### Output

**Escalation Hierarchy**

| Tier   | Team Size   | Expertise              | Issue Types                                    | Target Resolution |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Tier 1 | 35 agents   | General product        | Password, billing, how-to, basic config        | 1 hour, 80% FCR   |
| Tier 2 | 12 agents   | Technical support      | Integrations, advanced config, troubleshooting | 4 hours           |
| Tier 3 | 3 engineers | Development            | Bugs, data issues, infrastructure              | 24 hours          |
| Tier 4 | On-call     | Engineering leadership | Critical outages, security incidents           | Immediate         |

**Automatic Escalation Triggers**

```
Escalate Tier 1 → Tier 2:
- Issue category = "Integration" OR "API"
- Customer tier = "Enterprise" AND wait time > 30 minutes
- Ticket reopened 2+ times

Escalate Tier 2 → Tier 3:
- Confirmed bug requiring code change
- Data corruption or loss issue
- Troubleshooting > 2 hours without resolution

Escalate to Tier 4 (Critical):
- Production outage affecting multiple customers
- Security breach or data exposure
- Revenue-impacting issue for enterprise account
```

**Handoff Protocol**

1. Document issue thoroughly: Steps taken, findings, customer sentiment
2. Tag and categorize: Apply escalation reason, priority level
3. Warm transfer: Brief next tier via internal chat/call before assignment
4. Customer communication: "I'm connecting you with our specialist team who can best resolve this"
5. Confirm ownership: Receiving agent acknowledges within 15 minutes

**Severity Matrix**
| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Escalation Path |
|----------|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| P1-Critical | Service down, multiple users impacted | 15 minutes | Direct to Tier 3, notify leadership |
| P2-High | Major feature broken, workaround unavailable | 2 hours | Tier 2 with Tier 3 shadow |
| P3-Medium | Feature issue with workaround | 8 hours | Standard Tier 1 → 2 path |
| P4-Low | Minor issue, enhancement request | 48 hours | Tier 1, product team queue |

**Enterprise Customer Protocol**: All tickets auto-flagged, 30-minute response SLA, dedicated Tier 2 queue, named account engineer for Tier 3 escalations.

**Reduction Strategy**: Weekly escalation review identifying Tier 1 training gaps, knowledge base updates for repeated escalation patterns, product feedback for bug trends.

**Metrics**: Escalation rate (target: 20%), escalation resolution time, customer satisfaction post-escalation, unnecessary escalation rate (<5%).
