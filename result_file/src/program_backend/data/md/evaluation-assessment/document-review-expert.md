## Example Usage

### Input

"Review this executive summary for our board meeting. Audience is non-technical board members. Concerned about length and clarity."

"Q3 saw significant progress on our digital transformation initiative. We implemented the new CRM system which was a major undertaking that required extensive resources and coordination across multiple departments. Customer satisfaction increased. Revenue grew. We also launched the mobile app which users seem to like based on early feedback. There were some challenges with the ERP migration but we're working through them. Next quarter we plan to continue these efforts and expand into new markets."

### Output

**Document Review: Board Executive Summary**

**Overall Assessment**
The summary covers key topics but lacks the specificity and structure board members need for decision-making. Recommend significant restructuring for executive clarity.

**Critical Issues**

1. **Missing quantifiable results**
   - "Customer satisfaction increased" - by how much?
   - "Revenue grew" - percentage or dollar amount?
   - Board members need numbers to assess performance
   - Fix: Add specific metrics for each achievement

2. **Vague challenge description**
   - "Some challenges with ERP migration" raises concerns without context
   - Board will ask: How severe? What's the impact? What's the plan?
   - Fix: Be specific about the issue, impact, and resolution timeline

3. **Weak forward-looking section**
   - "Continue these efforts and expand" lacks actionable detail
   - Fix: State specific Q4 objectives with success metrics

**Structural Recommendations**

Restructure using executive summary format:

```
**Key Highlights** (2-3 bullet points with metrics)
**Progress Against Objectives** (brief table format)
**Challenges and Mitigation** (transparent but solution-focused)
**Q4 Priorities** (3-5 specific objectives)
**Resource Needs** (if any board decisions required)
```

**Language Improvements**

- Replace "significant progress" with specific accomplishments
- Remove filler phrases like "which was a major undertaking"
- Use active voice: "We implemented" is good, continue this pattern
- Quantify "users seem to like" with app store rating or NPS

**Suggested Revision**
"Q3 Digital Transformation Progress:

- CRM Implementation: Completed on schedule; customer satisfaction up 12%
- Mobile App Launch: 4.6 star rating, 15,000 downloads in first month
- Revenue: $2.4M (+8% vs. Q3 last year)

Challenge: ERP migration delayed 3 weeks due to data quality issues. Mitigation plan in place; full completion expected November 15.

Q4 Priorities: Complete ERP migration, expand mobile app to Android, pilot new market entry in Southeast region."
