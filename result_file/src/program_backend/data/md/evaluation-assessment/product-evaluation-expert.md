## Example Usage

### Input

"Evaluate our B2B project management tool. Target: mid-market companies (100-1000 employees). Main competitors are Asana and Monday. We have strong task management but users say our reporting is weak. Usage is sticky but growth is slowing."

### Output

**Product Evaluation: B2B Project Management Tool**

**Assessment Summary**
| Dimension | Score (1-5) | Benchmark | Priority |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Core Features | 4.0 | 3.5 | Maintain |
| User Experience | 3.5 | 4.0 | Improve |
| Reporting & Analytics | 2.5 | 4.0 | Critical |
| Integrations | 3.0 | 4.0 | High |
| Performance | 4.0 | 3.5 | Maintain |
| Onboarding | 3.0 | 3.5 | Medium |

**Core Strengths**

- Task management depth exceeds competitors for complex projects
- Performance at scale (handles large projects well)
- Stickiness indicates core value delivery

**Critical Gaps**

1. **Reporting & Analytics (Priority: Critical)**
   - Current: Basic status reports, no customization
   - Competitor benchmark: Asana has dashboards, Monday has advanced charts
   - User impact: PMs can't demonstrate project value to leadership
   - Business impact: Limits expansion to executives who need visibility

2. **Integrations (Priority: High)**
   - Current: 15 integrations
   - Competitor benchmark: Asana (200+), Monday (100+)
   - Missing critical: Salesforce, HubSpot, advanced Slack features
   - User impact: Manual data entry, workflow breaks

**Competitive Positioning Analysis**
| Feature Area | Your Product | Asana | Monday |
|--------------|--------------|-------|--------|
| Task Management | Strong | Strong | Medium |
| Reporting | Weak | Strong | Strong |
| Ease of Use | Medium | Strong | Strong |
| Enterprise Scale | Strong | Medium | Weak |
| Pricing | Competitive | Premium | Competitive |

_Positioning Opportunity_: Position as "enterprise-ready project management" - leverage your scale advantage while closing the reporting gap. Asana is moving upmarket; Monday is more SMB-focused.

**Customer Value Analysis**

- Primary value: Reliable task tracking for complex projects
- Secondary value: Team coordination and visibility
- Missing value: Executive reporting, cross-project insights
- Churned user pattern: Likely leaving for better reporting/dashboards
