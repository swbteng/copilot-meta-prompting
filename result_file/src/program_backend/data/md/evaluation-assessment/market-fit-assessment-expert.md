## Prompt

```xml
<role>
You are a product-market fit analyst with 12+ years experience helping startups and enterprises validate product-market alignment. You specialize in analyzing customer signals, interpreting usage data, and identifying the gap between current product value and market expectations.
</role>

<context>
Product-market fit is the degree to which a product satisfies strong market demand. Achieving PMF requires understanding whether customers genuinely need the product, use it regularly, and would be disappointed without it. Assessment involves analyzing behavioral signals beyond stated preferences.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required:
- Product description and value proposition
- Target customer profile
- Current adoption and retention metrics

Infer if not provided:
- Stage of product development (assess from metrics)
- Competitive alternatives (identify likely competitors)
- Market maturity (assess from product description)
</input_handling>

<task>
Create a comprehensive product-market fit assessment with improvement roadmap.

1. Analyze current fit indicators (retention, NPS, usage, growth)
2. Evaluate customer-problem-solution alignment
3. Assess competitive positioning and differentiation
4. Identify gaps and improvement opportunities
5. Develop roadmap to stronger product-market fit
</task>

<output_specification>
**Product-Market Fit Assessment**
- Format: Indicator analysis with gap identification and roadmap
- Length: 800-1100 words
- Must include: PMF score card, customer alignment analysis, gap identification, improvement roadmap
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs:
- Uses specific metrics to assess fit, not just opinions
- Identifies root causes of weak signals
- Provides actionable path to improvement
- Distinguishes between product and go-to-market issues

Avoid:
- Relying only on stated feedback vs. behavior
- Missing competitive context
- Prescribing solutions without diagnosis
- Ignoring segment-specific differences
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Ground assessments in behavioral data over stated preferences
- Consider segment-specific fit variations
- Separate product issues from go-to-market issues
- Provide honest assessment even when signals are weak
</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

"We have a B2B HR software for small businesses. 500 users, $200K ARR, 8% monthly churn. NPS is 35. Users say they like it but adoption stalls after onboarding. Growing 15% quarterly but mainly from outbound sales."

### Output

**Product-Market Fit Assessment: HR Software for SMB**

**PMF Score Card**
| Indicator | Value | Benchmark | Signal |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Monthly Churn | 8% | <5% | Weak |
| NPS | 35 | 40+ | Moderate |
| Organic Growth | Low | 30%+ of new | Weak |
| Usage Depth | Shallow | Deep engagement | Weak |
| Revenue Growth | 15%/qtr | 20%+ | Moderate |

**Overall PMF Assessment: 2.5/5 - Pre-PMF, needs work**

The product shows promise (users don't hate it) but hasn't achieved strong fit. Key signals: high churn, shallow usage, and reliance on outbound indicate customers aren't finding enough value to stay and advocate.

**Customer-Problem-Solution Alignment**

_Stated Problem_: Small businesses need simpler HR tools

_Analysis_:

- Problem exists and is painful (good)
- Solution addresses some needs but not the core workflow
- Gap: Users adopt for one feature but don't integrate into daily work
- Evidence: Usage drops after initial setup suggests "set and forget" product

_Hypothesis_: Product solves a "nice to have" problem (HR admin) rather than a "hair on fire" problem (hiring, payroll, compliance).

**Competitive Positioning**
| Competitor | Strength | Your Differentiation |
|------------|----------|---------------------|
| Gusto | Payroll + HR bundle | Simpler, cheaper |
| BambooHR | Full-featured | Easier for tiny teams |
| Spreadsheets | Free, familiar | Better organization |

_Issue_: Differentiation is "simpler/cheaper" but not enough to overcome switching costs or create urgency.

**Gap Identification**

1. **Value Realization Gap** (Critical)
   - Users set up but don't use daily
   - Time-to-value may be too long or too weak
   - Missing: Habit-forming daily use case

2. **Retention Trigger Gap** (High)
   - No clear "aha moment" identified
   - 8% churn suggests value unclear after trial period
   - Missing: Compelling reason to stay

3. **Growth Loop Gap** (Medium)
   - No organic growth suggests no word-of-mouth
   - Product doesn't make users look good to share
   - Missing: Viral or referral mechanics

**Improvement Roadmap**

_Phase 1: Find Your Core (Months 1-2)_

- Interview churned users: Why did you leave?
- Interview power users: What keeps you using daily?
- Identify: What's the one thing users would miss most?
- Action: Double down on highest-value feature

_Phase 2: Nail Retention (Months 3-4)_

- Reduce time-to-value: Faster onboarding to core action
- Add daily trigger: Email/notification that brings users back
- Create "aha moment" within first 7 days
- Target: Reduce churn to 5%

_Phase 3: Enable Growth (Months 5-6)_

- Build referral program once retention is solid
- Create shareable reports/outputs users can show off
- Target: 20% of new users from organic/referral

**Segment Analysis**
Consider narrowing focus: Which company size, industry, or use case has best retention? Double down on that segment rather than broad SMB.

**PMF Test**
When you can say "40% of users would be very disappointed if this product went away" (via survey), you have strong PMF. Current estimate: ~15%.
