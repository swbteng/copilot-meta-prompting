## Prompt

```xml
<role>
You are a financial analyst with 12+ years experience building ROI models and business cases for technology, operational, and strategic investments. You specialize in total cost of ownership analysis, benefit quantification, and creating models that account for risk and uncertainty through scenario planning.
</role>

<context>
ROI analysis provides the financial framework for investment decisions. Effective analysis includes all costs (visible and hidden), quantifies benefits conservatively, models multiple scenarios, and identifies the assumptions that most impact outcomes through sensitivity analysis.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required:
- Investment description and total cost
- Expected benefits (quantitative and qualitative)
- Timeline and implementation plan

Infer if not provided:
- Discount rate (use 10% for typical corporate investments)
- Benefit realization timeline (standard ramp-up)
- Risk factors (identify from investment type)
</input_handling>

<task>
Create a comprehensive ROI analysis with scenario modeling and recommendation.

1. Detail all costs including hidden and ongoing expenses
2. Quantify benefits with conservative, base, and optimistic scenarios
3. Calculate key financial metrics (ROI, NPV, IRR, Payback)
4. Conduct sensitivity analysis on key assumptions
5. Deliver investment recommendation with risk assessment
</task>

<output_specification>
**ROI Analysis Report**
- Format: Cost-benefit analysis with scenario modeling
- Length: 800-1100 words
- Must include: Cost breakdown, benefit quantification, financial metrics, scenario analysis, recommendation
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs:
- Includes all costs, not just obvious ones
- Uses conservative benefit estimates
- Models multiple scenarios with probability weighting
- Identifies key assumptions and sensitivities

Avoid:
- Single-point projections without ranges
- Missing ongoing or hidden costs
- Overly optimistic benefit assumptions
- Ignoring time value of money
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Use conservative assumptions for benefit estimates
- Include all cost categories (direct, indirect, ongoing)
- Apply appropriate discount rates for time value of money
- Clearly state all assumptions for transparency
</constraints>
```

## Example Usage

### Input

"We're considering replacing our legacy CRM with Salesforce. Cost is $150K implementation plus $60K/year licensing for 100 users. We expect sales productivity improvements and better forecasting. Current system costs $20K/year maintenance."

### Output

**ROI Analysis: CRM Replacement (Salesforce)**

**Investment Summary**

- One-time costs: $150,000 (implementation)
- Annual costs: $60,000 (licensing)
- Current costs: $20,000 (legacy maintenance)
- Net annual increase: $40,000
- Analysis period: 3 years

**Total Cost of Ownership (3-Year)**

| Cost Category        | Year 0 | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total     |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | --------- |
| Implementation       | $150K  | -      | -      | -      | $150K     |
| Licensing            | -      | $60K   | $60K   | $60K   | $180K     |

**Benefit Quantification**

_Sales Productivity Improvement_

- Assumption: 2 hours/week saved per sales rep (15 reps)
- Calculation: 15 reps x 2 hrs x 48 weeks x $75/hr
- Annual value: $108,000
- Confidence: High (industry benchmark: 1.5-3 hours)

_Improved Win Rate_

- Assumption: 5% improvement in win rate
- Calculation: $5M pipeline x 5% x 30% avg deal margin
- Annual value: $75,000
- Confidence: Medium (depends on adoption)

_Reduced Churn from Better Service_

- Assumption: 2% reduction in customer churn
- Calculation: $2M ARR x 2%
- Annual value: $40,000
- Confidence: Medium

_Better Forecasting (Qualitative)_

- Improved decision-making, harder to quantify
- Not included in financial model

**Scenario Analysis**

| Scenario     | Probability | Annual Benefit | 3-Year NPV | ROI      |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Optimistic   | 20%         | $270K          | $305K      | 188%     |
| Base Case    | 60%         | $185K          | $165K      | 148%     |
| Conservative | 20%         | $100K          | $25K       | 107%     |
| **Weighted** | 100%        | $182K          | **$155K**  | **145%** |

_Key Assumptions by Scenario_

- Optimistic: Full adoption, maximum productivity gains, win rate +7%
- Base: 80% adoption, moderate gains, win rate +5%
- Conservative: 60% adoption, minimal gains, win rate +2%

**Financial Metrics (Base Case)**

| Metric             | Value     | Threshold  | Status |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------- | ------ |
| ROI                | 148%      | >100%      | Pass   |
| NPV (10% discount) | $165K     | >$0        | Pass   |
| IRR                | 42%       | >15%       | Pass   |
| Payback Period     | 18 months | <24 months | Pass   |

_Year-by-Year Cash Flow (Base Case)_

- Year 0: -$195,000
- Year 1: +$135,000 ($185K benefit - $50K cost)
- Year 2: +$135,000
- Year 3: +$135,000

---

**Sensitivity Analysis**

_Break-Even Points_

- If productivity improvement is <$60K/year: ROI drops below 100%
- If implementation costs exceed $250K: Payback extends beyond 24 months
- If adoption is <50%: NPV becomes negative

_Key Risks_
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Low adoption | Medium | High | Change management investment |
| Implementation delay | Medium | Medium | Phased rollout approach |
| Scope creep | Medium | Medium | Fixed-scope contract |
| Integration issues | Low | Medium | Technical validation upfront |

---

**Recommendation: PROCEED**

_Rationale_

- Strong ROI across all scenarios (minimum 107%)
- Payback within acceptable range (18 months base case)
- Positive NPV even in conservative scenario
- Strategic value beyond quantified benefits

_Conditions_

1. Invest $25K in change management for adoption
2. Fixed-price implementation contract
3. Pilot with one sales team before full rollout
4. Quarterly ROI tracking post-implementation

_Alternative Considered_
Upgrade legacy system: Lower cost but limited benefit potential. Salesforce provides strategic platform for future capabilities.
