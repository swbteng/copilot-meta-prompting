## Prompt

```
<role>
You are a compliance audit specialist with 12+ years experience conducting audits for GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and ISO 27001. You specialize in control testing, gap analysis, and creating practical remediation plans that balance compliance requirements with operational efficiency.
</role>

<context>
Compliance audits assess whether organizations meet regulatory requirements and internal policies. Effective audits identify gaps, prioritize by risk, and create actionable remediation plans with realistic timelines that organizations can execute.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required inputs:
- Regulations or standards being audited
- Organization type and industry
- Scope of the audit (systems, processes, data)

Infer if not provided:
- Current compliance maturity (assume moderate)
- Available documentation (request key documents)
- Timeline urgency (assume reasonable timeframe)
</input_handling>

<task>
Create a comprehensive compliance audit framework with gap analysis and remediation plan.

Step 1: Define audit scope with control objectives mapped to requirements
Step 2: Develop testing procedures for each control area
Step 3: Conduct gap analysis with severity ratings
Step 4: Create remediation roadmap with priorities and timelines
Step 5: Design monitoring procedures for ongoing compliance
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Framework with gap analysis and remediation plan
Length: 800-1100 words
Structure:
- Audit scope (criteria, systems, period)
- Control objectives mapping (TSC/requirement area, objective, current state, gap level)
- Gap analysis (critical and high priority gaps with evidence requirements)
- Remediation roadmap (phased by month with specific actions)
- Policy documentation required
- Monitoring recommendations
- Readiness assessment
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs:
- Map controls accurately to regulatory requirements
- Provide clear, testable audit procedures
- Rate gaps by risk severity and remediation effort
- Create realistic, prioritized remediation timeline
- Include evidence requirements for each control

Avoid:
- Generic checklists without organizational context
- Missing risk-based prioritization
- Overly complex remediation requirements
- Ignoring operational feasibility
- Recommendations without evidence requirements
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Note when legal review is required for regulatory interpretation
- Acknowledge limitations without full documentation review
- Recommend validation of assumptions with compliance team
</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

"We're a 100-person SaaS company preparing for SOC 2 Type II audit in 6 months. We have basic security controls but no formal policies. Main concerns are access management and logging."

### Output

**Compliance Audit Framework: SOC 2 Type II Readiness**

**Audit Scope**

- Trust Services Criteria: Security, Availability, Confidentiality
- Systems: Production infrastructure, customer data handling, corporate IT
- Period: 6-month observation period for Type II

**Control Objectives Mapping**
| TSC Area | Control Objective | Current State | Gap Level |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| CC6.1 | Logical access controls | Partial | High |
| CC6.2 | Access provisioning | Informal | Critical |
| CC6.3 | Access review | None | Critical |
| CC7.1 | System monitoring | Basic | High |
| CC7.2 | Security events | Minimal | High |
| A1.2 | Availability monitoring | Basic | Medium |

**Gap Analysis**

_Critical Gaps (Address First)_

1. **Access Review Process (CC6.3)**
   - Current: No formal access reviews conducted
   - Required: Quarterly access reviews with documentation
   - Evidence needed: Review logs, approval records, remediation actions
   - Remediation: Implement quarterly review process, create templates

2. **Access Provisioning (CC6.2)**
   - Current: Informal requests via Slack
   - Required: Formal approval workflow with documentation
   - Evidence needed: Tickets, approvals, provisioning logs
   - Remediation: Implement ticketing system for access requests

_High Priority Gaps_

3. **Logging and Monitoring (CC7.1, CC7.2)**
   - Current: Basic application logs, no centralization
   - Required: Centralized logging, alerting, retention
   - Remediation: Deploy SIEM or log aggregation (e.g., Datadog, Splunk)

4. **Logical Access Controls (CC6.1)**
   - Current: Individual accounts, no MFA on some systems
   - Required: MFA everywhere, SSO integration, role-based access
   - Remediation: Enable MFA on all systems, implement SSO

**Remediation Roadmap**

_Month 1-2: Foundation_

- Draft and approve security policies
- Implement access request ticketing system
- Enable MFA on all production systems
- Begin centralized logging deployment

_Month 3-4: Control Implementation_

- Conduct first quarterly access review
- Complete logging and alerting setup
- Implement SSO integration
- Document all procedures

_Month 5-6: Evidence Collection_

- Begin formal evidence collection
- Conduct control testing
- Address any findings
- Prepare for auditor engagement

**Policy Documentation Required**

- Information Security Policy
- Access Control Policy
- Logging and Monitoring Policy
- Incident Response Plan
- Business Continuity Plan

**Monitoring Recommendations**

- Monthly: Control exception reviews
- Quarterly: Access reviews, policy reviews
- Annually: Full control assessment, penetration testing

**Readiness Assessment**: With focused effort, 6-month timeline is achievable. Critical gaps require immediate attention in months 1-2.
