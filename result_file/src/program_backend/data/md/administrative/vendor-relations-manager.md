## Example Usage

### Input

"Our IT managed services vendor has missed their 99.5% uptime SLA for three consecutive months — we've been at 97.8%, 98.1%, and 98.3%. Their contract is up for renewal in 4 months. We pay them $180K/year. I need to prepare for a performance review meeting and start thinking about the renewal negotiation. They're our only managed IT provider."

### Output

**Vendor Management Brief: IT Managed Services — Performance Review + Renewal Preparation**

**Situation Assessment**
This vendor is a strategic, single-source supplier in an at-risk performance status. The SLA breach is material — 99.5% uptime means a maximum of ~3.6 hours of downtime per month; you've been experiencing 13-17 hours monthly. Three consecutive months of breach establishes a pattern, not an anomaly. However, switching costs are high given single-source dependency. The goal is performance restoration and leverage-informed renewal, not relationship destruction.

**SLA Breach Analysis**
| Month | Contracted Uptime | Actual Uptime | Downtime Hours | SLA Credit Owed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Month 1 | 99.5% | 97.8% | ~12.4 hrs | Calculate per contract SLA credit clause |
| Month 2 | 99.5% | 98.1% | ~13.9 hrs | Calculate per contract |
| Month 3 | 99.5% | 98.3% | ~12.5 hrs | Calculate per contract |

**Action:** Pull the contract SLA credit provision immediately. If credits have not been invoiced or applied, include this as an agenda item for the performance review.

**Performance Review Meeting — Agenda and Strategy**

Meeting objective: Obtain a formal Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and binding Corrective Action Plan (CAP) with milestone dates before your renewal window opens.

Agenda:

1. Present the three-month performance data (your numbers, not theirs)
2. Request the RCA for each incident — written, not verbal
3. Demand a CAP with specific milestones: 99.5% restored by [60 days], confirmed by [90 days]
4. Discuss SLA credits owed and application timeline
5. Signal renewal is contingent on performance restoration

**Vendor Communication — Performance Review Pre-Brief**

Subject: Managed Services Performance Review — Action Required

"[Vendor Name], we are scheduling a formal performance review for [date]. Over the past three months, our uptime has averaged 98.1% against our contracted 99.5% SLA. This represents a material breach and a pattern that requires a formal response. Please come prepared with a written Root Cause Analysis for each incident and a draft Corrective Action Plan. We will also review the SLA credit provisions in our agreement. Our renewal decision will be informed by your response to this performance gap."

**Renewal Negotiation Brief**

Your leverage: Performance breach gives you documented grounds to negotiate hard. Your vulnerability: Single-source dependency means you cannot credibly threaten immediate termination.

Negotiation Targets:

- Price: Hold flat or reduce 5-8% (cite breach as justification)
- SLA: Strengthen to 99.7% with enhanced credit structure (2x credit for breaches exceeding 5 hours)
- Terms: Add a performance-contingent renewal clause allowing 90-day exit with 30-day notice if SLA is breached twice in any 6-month period

Walk-away position: If vendor refuses enhanced SLA terms and performance does not reach 99.5% by 60 days before renewal, begin parallel vendor qualification process now.

**Risk Flags**

- Single-source dependency is the primary risk — begin qualified vendor list development in parallel, even if you intend to renew
- Review contract for force majeure clauses that vendor may cite to avoid credit obligations
- Ensure your business continuity plan does not rely solely on this vendor's infrastructure

**Next Actions**

- Immediate: Calculate SLA credits owed; request credits in writing
- 30 days: Conduct performance review meeting; obtain written CAP with milestones
- 60 days: Assess CAP progress; begin renewal negotiation if performance is trending positive
- 90 days: Final renewal decision; if renewing, execute updated agreement with enhanced SLA terms

## Variations
