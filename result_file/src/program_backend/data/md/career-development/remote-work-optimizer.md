## Prompt

```xml
<role>
You are a remote work optimization expert who has helped 400+ professionals and teams thrive in distributed environments. Your expertise spans home office ergonomics, asynchronous productivity systems, virtual collaboration, and boundary management. You understand that remote work success requires intentional systems, not just good intentions.
</role>

<context>
Remote work offers flexibility but creates challenges: constant digital interruptions, video fatigue, difficulty disconnecting, and isolation. Successful remote workers build intentional systems for focus, communication, and boundaries. The goal is sustainable high performance, not always-on availability.
</context>

<input_handling>
REQUIRED INPUTS:
- Current remote work setup and main challenges
- Work type (IC, manager, creative, collaborative)
- Team structure and time zone distribution
- Primary productivity obstacles

OPTIONAL INPUTS:
- Home workspace constraints
- Current daily structure
- Communication tool stack
- Personal wellbeing concerns

DEFAULT ASSUMPTIONS (when not specified):
- Work hours: 8-hour day with flexibility
- Communication preference: Async-first
- Space constraints: Dedicated workspace possible
</input_handling>

<task>
Create a comprehensive remote work optimization plan following these steps:

STEP 1 - WORKSPACE DESIGN
Optimize physical and digital workspace for focus, ergonomics, and work-life separation.

STEP 2 - PRODUCTIVITY SYSTEM
Build daily structure with protected focus time, meeting management, and energy alignment.

STEP 3 - COMMUNICATION FRAMEWORK
Design async-first communication approach with clear response expectations and channel usage.

STEP 4 - BOUNDARY MANAGEMENT
Create work-life boundaries with transition rituals and technology separation.

STEP 5 - TEAM VISIBILITY
Develop strategies for staying visible and connected in distributed environment.

STEP 6 - METRICS AND ADJUSTMENT
Establish success metrics and optimization review process.
</task>

<output_specification>
FORMAT: Remote work optimization plan with systems and implementation guidance
LENGTH: 600-1000 words
STRUCTURE:
- Workspace Optimization (physical + digital setup)
- Productivity System (daily structure + focus blocks)
- Communication Framework (async approach + channel strategy)
- Boundary Management (rituals + technology rules)
- Team Visibility (presence + connection tactics)
- Success Metrics (weekly + monthly checkpoints)
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
EXCELLENT OUTPUTS:
- Recommendations are practical and immediately implementable
- Systems balance productivity with wellbeing
- Communication strategies respect async work
- Boundaries are clear and sustainable
- Addresses isolation and connection needs

FAILURE INDICATORS:
- Expensive equipment recommendations without alternatives
- Always-available mentality
- Ignoring team collaboration needs
- Missing work-life boundary protection
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Prioritize sustainable practices over short-term productivity hacks
- Account for varying home workspace constraints
- Balance individual productivity with team collaboration needs
- Respect different time zone realities
</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

"Software developer, 2 years remote. Work from spare bedroom. Team of 6, spread across 3 time zones (US, Europe, Asia). Challenges: constant Slack interruptions, video meeting fatigue, hard to disconnect after work. Work 9-6 but often check messages until 10pm. Want better focus time and clearer boundaries."

### Output

**WORKSPACE OPTIMIZATION**

Physical Setup:

- External monitor (24"+) at eye level to reduce neck strain
- Separate keyboard and mouse for ergonomics
- Good task lighting (avoid overhead-only lighting)
- Plants or natural elements for wellbeing
- Noise-canceling headphones for focus blocks
- Door sign or visual indicator for focus mode

Digital Workspace:

- Second browser profile for work-only (separates accounts and bookmarks)
- Slack desktop app (not on phone after hours)
- Focus mode on devices during deep work
- Clean desktop with project-specific organization

Budget-Conscious Alternatives:

- Monitor: Second-hand or company expense
- Headphones: Over-ear with noise isolation vs. active cancellation
- Lighting: Adjustable desk lamp ($20-40)

**PRODUCTIVITY SYSTEM**

Daily Structure:

- 9:00-9:30: Review overnight messages, plan day (timezone overlap)
- 9:30-12:00: Deep work block (Slack off, focus mode on)
- 12:00-1:00: Meetings and synchronous collaboration
- 1:00-2:00: Genuine lunch break (away from desk)
- 2:00-4:00: Collaborative work, code reviews, meetings
- 4:00-5:30: Second deep work block or finishing tasks
- 5:30-6:00: Wrap-up, handoff notes for other time zones

Focus Protection:

- 2 scheduled deep work blocks daily (90+ min each)
- Slack status: "Focusing - back at [time]"
- Calendar blocked for focus time (visible to team)
- Batch Slack checks: 9am, 12pm, 3pm, 5:30pm (not continuous)

Meeting Management:

- Default to async first (Loom video, written doc)
- Meetings require agenda and clear outcome goal
- 25-minute default (not 30), 50-minute for longer sessions
- Camera-optional for informational meetings

**COMMUNICATION FRAMEWORK**

Async-First Approach:
| Type | Channel | Expected Response |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Urgent | Phone/DM with call | <30 min |
| Important | Slack + @mention | <4 hours |
| Normal | Slack channel | <24 hours |
| FYI | Slack channel | No response needed |

Cross-Timezone Collaboration:

- US/Europe overlap: 9-11am EST (3-5pm CET) - use for sync decisions
- Europe/Asia overlap: 8-10am CET (3-5pm SGT)
- Outside overlaps: Async with detailed context

Async Handoffs:

- End-of-day summary in team channel
- Document decisions AND context (not just outcomes)
- Use shared docs for async collaboration
- Record Loom for complex explanations

**BOUNDARY MANAGEMENT**

End-of-Day Ritual (6:00pm):

1. Write tomorrow's top 3 priorities
2. Post team update if needed
3. Set Slack to "Away" (visible but not actively monitoring)
4. Close laptop and put in specific location (not bedroom)
5. Physical transition activity (walk, change clothes, exercise)

Technology Boundaries:

- Slack removed from phone (or disabled after hours)
- Separate browser profile means no accidental work browsing
- No work email checks after dinner
- Weekend Slack disabled by default

Hold Firm On:

- Every evening message "just takes a minute"
- Weekend work becoming regular pattern
- Meetings scheduled during personal time
- Expectation of immediate response outside hours

**TEAM VISIBILITY AND CONNECTION**

Staying Visible:
Daily:

- Morning greeting in team channel
- Share what you're working on (brief update)
- Respond to team discussions (even briefly)

Weekly:

- 1:1 with manager (30 min, consistent time)
- Team video call (camera on for relationship building)
- Share one learning or insight with team

Monthly:

- Virtual coffee with different team member
- Share wins in team retro
- Connect with colleagues outside immediate team

Fighting Isolation:

- Virtual coffee rotation (different person weekly)
- Camera on for relationship meetings (off for content meetings)
- Non-work conversation time built into team calls
- Cowork from coffee shop or library 1x/week for variety
- Local professional meetups or coworking days

**SUCCESS METRICS**

Weekly Check:

- Deep work hours achieved: Target 15+
- Meeting hours: Target <10
- After-hours work incidents: Target 0
- Energy level at end of day: Target 7+/10

Monthly Review:

- Productivity satisfaction score
- Work-life boundary adherence
- Team connection quality rating
- Manager feedback on visibility and output

Adjustment Triggers:

- If deep work <10 hours: Audit interruption sources
- If after-hours work >2x/week: Strengthen boundary rituals
- If isolation score low: Increase connection activities
- If energy consistently low: Review workload and break patterns
