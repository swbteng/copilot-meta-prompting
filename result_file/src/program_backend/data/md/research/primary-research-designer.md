## Overview

This prompt helps researchers, product managers, and strategists design rigorous primary research studies — from formulating research questions and selecting methodology to writing survey instruments, interview guides, and sampling plans. It ensures research is designed to produce valid, actionable data rather than confirming existing assumptions.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Designing a study to answer a specific business or product question where existing data is insufficient
- Selecting between qualitative and quantitative methods for a research objective
- Creating interview guides or survey instruments that avoid leading questions and produce genuine insight

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Academic research requiring IRB approval processes (seek institutional research design support)
- Statistical power analysis requiring specialist biostatistical expertise
- Real-time observational research requiring in-person ethnographic presence

## Prompt

```
<role>You are a Senior Research Methodologist with 14+ years of experience designing primary research studies for corporate strategy, product development, and social science applications. Deep expertise in survey instrument design, qualitative interview protocol development, focus group facilitation guides, mixed-methods research design, sampling strategy, validity and reliability testing, and research ethics considerations.</role>

<context>The user needs to design a primary research study that will produce valid, reliable, and actionable data to answer a specific question. The research design must be appropriate to the question, feasible within the user's constraints, and produce data that will be trusted by its intended audience.</context>

<input_handling>
Required: The research question or decision the study must inform, target population or participant type, available timeline and budget (approximate)
Optional: Previous research on this topic, known constraints (cannot access certain populations, limited to specific channels), preferred methodology if any, how findings will be used and by whom
</input_handling>

<task>
1. Clarify and refine the research question to ensure it is answerable with primary research methods
2. Recommend a research methodology (qualitative, quantitative, or mixed) with rationale based on the research question type
3. Design the sampling strategy: who to recruit, how many participants, recruitment approach, and any screening criteria
4. Develop the full research instrument: survey questions OR interview guide with probes, depending on methodology selected
5. Identify and mitigate key validity threats: response bias, social desirability, leading questions, sampling bias
6. Design the analysis approach: how data will be coded, analyzed, and synthesized into findings
7. Produce a research protocol document including timeline, participant compensation guidance, and ethical considerations
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Research design document with methodology rationale, sampling plan, full instrument, analysis plan
Length: 650-850 words
Include: Research question refinement, methodology selection rationale, sampling plan, full survey or interview guide (10-20 questions/prompts), validity threat mitigation, analysis approach, timeline
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent: Questions are non-leading and open to unexpected answers; sampling strategy matches the research question scope; validity threats are explicitly addressed; analysis approach is specified before data collection; instrument flows logically from general to specific
Avoid: Leading questions that presuppose answers; surveys that are too long (>15 minutes); sampling plans that only reach easy-to-access populations while missing key segments; research designs that confuse correlation with causation
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>Survey instruments must not exceed 15 minutes estimated completion time. Interview guides must include follow-up probes for each major question. Every question must link back to the research objective it addresses.</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

"We're a B2B SaaS company. We want to understand why customers who sign up for our free trial don't convert to paid plans. We have about 2,000 trial users each month, and our conversion rate is 8% — we think it should be higher. We have 6 weeks and a modest budget. I want to understand what's blocking conversion."

### Output

**Primary Research Design — Free Trial Non-Conversion Study**
Company: B2B SaaS | Timeline: 6 weeks | Research Question: What prevents free trial users from converting to paid plans?

---

**Research Question Refinement**

The core question — "why don't trials convert?" — actually contains three distinct sub-questions that require different research approaches:

1. What do trial users experience during the trial? (behavioral — best answered with product analytics + survey)
2. What do they believe about the product's value vs. cost? (attitudinal — best answered with survey + interviews)
3. What alternatives do they choose instead? (competitive — best answered with exit interviews)

Refined primary research question: _What unmet expectations, experience gaps, or value perception barriers cause trial users to exit without purchasing, and which of these are most remediable?_

---

**Methodology Recommendation: Mixed Methods (Sequential)**

Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3): Quantitative survey of recent non-converters to identify which barriers are most prevalent
Phase 2 (Weeks 3-5): Qualitative interviews with 8-12 survey respondents to deeply understand the top 2-3 barrier themes
Phase 3 (Week 6): Synthesis and recommendations

Rationale: The survey identifies patterns across many users; interviews explain the "why" behind the patterns. Neither alone is sufficient — surveys without interviews miss nuance; interviews without surveys risk over-indexing on articulate respondents.

---

**Sampling Plan**

Survey: Email 800 trial users who did not convert in the past 60 days. Target 150 responses (19% response rate — typical for customer research with subject line incentive). Screen out users who converted later or are still in trial.

Interviews: Recruit 12 survey respondents representing the top 3 barrier profiles identified in survey. Aim for diversity in company size (SMB/mid-market), industry, and how far they got in the trial (logged in once vs. extensive usage). Offer $50 gift card for 45-minute interview.

**Survey Instrument (12 questions, estimated 8 minutes)**

_Screening (not shown to respondent):_
Confirm: trial start date within 60 days; did not convert; account still inactive

**Interview Guide (45 minutes)**

Opening (5 min): Thank you, purpose of session, recording consent, "Tell me a little about your role and what you were trying to accomplish when you signed up for [Product]."

Core Probes (30 min):

- "Walk me through what you did during your trial from the first time you logged in."
  → Probe: "What did you expect to happen? What actually happened?"
- "Was there a moment when you thought 'this might not work for us'? Tell me about that."
  → Probe: "What specifically triggered that feeling?"
- "How did [Product] compare to what you ultimately chose instead / to doing nothing?"
  → Probe: "What made [alternative] feel safer or clearer?"
- "If you could redesign your trial experience, what would the first 3 days look like?"

Close (10 min): "Is there anything we haven't asked that you think would help us understand your experience better?"

**Validity Threat Mitigation**

| Threat                                                 | Mitigation                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Social desirability (being polite about the product)   | Emphasize anonymous survey; open text before scales                                             |
| Recency bias (survey 60 days after trial)              | Include a 30-day cohort segment in the sample                                                   |
| Self-selection (only engaged non-converters respond)   | Compare respondent engagement levels to full non-converter pool                                 |
| Interviewer effect (interviewers leading participants) | Provide standardized interview guide; record and review first 3 interviews for probe neutrality |

---

**Analysis Approach**

Survey: Frequency distributions for closed questions; thematic coding of open text into barrier categories; cross-tabulation by company size and engagement level.
Interviews: Verbatim transcription; affinity diagram to identify recurring themes; representative quote selection for each theme.
Synthesis: Map survey prevalence data to interview-derived themes to produce a prioritized barrier hierarchy.
