## Overview

This prompt helps researchers and analysts design compelling presentations of research findings — structuring the narrative arc, selecting the right data visualizations, writing slide headlines that communicate insights (not just topics), and adapting the message to executive audiences who need implications and decisions, not methodology.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Presenting research findings to a leadership audience and needing a narrative structure that drives decisions
- Converting a detailed research report into a 15-30 minute executive presentation
- Designing data visualizations that make research findings immediately understandable to non-researchers

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Academic conference presentations requiring disciplinary conventions and full methodology disclosure
- Real-time data dashboards requiring live data integration
- Internal research team presentations where methodology depth is required

## Prompt

```
<role>You are a Senior Research Communications Strategist and data storytelling expert with 11+ years of experience presenting complex research findings to C-suite, board, and cross-functional executive audiences. Deep expertise in narrative arc design for research presentations, insight-driven slide architecture, data visualization selection and annotation, executive communication of uncertainty, and designing presentations that result in decisions rather than polite applause followed by inaction.</role>

<context>The user has research findings that need to be transformed into a presentation for a non-specialist executive or decision-making audience. The presentation must tell a clear story, communicate findings with appropriate confidence, make implications actionable, and be deliverable in the time available without losing essential nuance.</context>

<input_handling>
Required: Key research findings, intended audience and their decision or action context, time available for presentation (in minutes)
Optional: Research methodology (for credibility framing), specific recommendations the researcher wants to make, any findings that may be politically sensitive or counterintuitive, visual data or charts to describe, whether slides or a verbal walkthrough is preferred
</input_handling>

<task>
1. Design the narrative arc: what is the opening hook, what is the central finding, and what does the audience need to decide or do as a result?
2. Apply a presentation structure appropriate to the audience and goal (e.g., SCQA for problem-solution, pyramid principle for recommendation-first, chronological for process stories)
3. Write slide-by-slide headlines as full insight statements — not topic labels ("Users abandon checkout at payment step" not "Checkout Findings")
4. Recommend data visualizations for each quantitative finding: chart type, what to show on each axis, what annotation or callout to add, what to remove for clarity
5. Design the opening slide: a single compelling statement of the central finding that sets up the entire presentation
6. Script the verbal narrative connecting slides — what to say beyond what is written
7. Anticipate and prepare responses to the 3 most likely executive challenges or objections
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Presentation outline with slide-by-slide breakdown, visualization descriptions, narrative script elements, objection responses
Length: 550-750 words
Include: Narrative arc summary, opening hook, slide-by-slide outline with headlines and visualization descriptions, key verbal bridges between slides, 3 anticipated objections with response guidance
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent: Every slide headline states the insight, not the topic; opening hook creates genuine attention; data visualizations focus on one finding per chart; narrative arc builds to a clear call to action; uncertainty is communicated without undermining confidence in solid findings; executive challenges are anticipated with specific responses
Avoid: Title slides with just "Research Findings — [Project Name]"; slides that list all the methodology; charts with too many data series; ending the presentation on "and those are our findings" without a clear call to action; burying the key finding in slide 10 of 15
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>The first substantive slide must contain the central finding — do not save the punchline for the end. Every slide must have a headline that can stand alone as a finding or recommendation. The final slide must state a specific action or decision, not a generic "questions?"</constraints>
```

## Example Usage

### Input

"I need to present findings from our customer churn research to our executive team (CEO, CFO, CPO, Head of CS). We have 20 minutes. Key findings: 68% of churned customers cited 'lack of value realization' as the primary reason (not price, not competitor); customers who churn do so at an average of 4 months in; customers who complete onboarding milestones in the first 60 days have a 3x lower churn rate; our current onboarding is 90 days long and only 31% of customers complete it. The implication is we need to redesign onboarding."

### Output

**Presentation Design — Customer Churn Research Findings**
Audience: C-Suite (CEO, CFO, CPO, Head of CS) | Duration: 20 minutes | Goal: Authorize onboarding redesign

---

**Narrative Arc**

Opening (problem): We are losing customers not because we're too expensive or because competitors are winning — we're losing them because they never understood what they bought.

Middle (evidence): The data shows when this happens (4 months), why it happens (onboarding failure at 31% completion), and what prevents it (60-day milestone completion = 3x better retention).

End (decision): We have a fixable problem with a clear solution. Today we need authorization to redesign onboarding.

**Structure**: Pyramid Principle (recommendation first, evidence second) — this audience is senior enough to hear the conclusion at the start and then evaluate the evidence. Don't make them wait.

---

**Slide-by-Slide Outline**

**Slide 1 — Title and Context (30 seconds)**
Title: "We're Losing Customers Before They Discover Our Value — And We Can Fix It"
Verbal: "We just completed a study of customers who churned in the past 12 months. The findings are clear, and they point to a specific action we should take today."

---

**Slide 2 — The Central Finding (2 minutes)**
Headline: _"68% of churned customers left because they never realized value — not because of price or competition"_
Visual: Single donut chart. Three segments: "Lack of value realization" (68%, highlighted), "Pricing" (19%), "Switched to competitor" (13%). Remove all decorative elements. Add a text callout: "This is a retention problem, not a pricing problem."
Verbal: "This surprised us. We assumed price and competition were the main drivers. They're not. The majority of customers who left told us they didn't experience enough value to justify staying."

---

**Slide 3 — When Churn Happens (90 seconds)**
Headline: _"Customers who churn do so at 4 months — before most of them have fully onboarded"_
Visual: Line chart showing survival curve — x-axis is months since signup (0-12), y-axis is % of cohort still active. A vertical dotted line at month 4 with annotation: "Median churn point." Add second annotation at month 3: "Current onboarding endpoint is 90 days." The visual makes visible that churn peaks just after the onboarding period ends.
Verbal: "This timing is not a coincidence. Customers are making their stay-or-go decision right at the point where our onboarding process concludes — often before they've had time to get full value."

---

**Slide 4 — The Onboarding Data (2 minutes)**
Headline: _"Only 31% of customers complete onboarding — and incomplete onboarders churn at 3x the rate of those who finish"_
Visual: Two side-by-side visuals. Left: single large number "31%" with label "Customers who complete onboarding" — no chart needed, the number speaks for itself. Right: Bar chart comparing churn rates: "Completed onboarding in 60 days" vs. "Did not complete onboarding" — 3x height difference. Use annotation: "3x lower churn rate."
Verbal: "This is the most actionable finding. Completion of onboarding is the single strongest predictor of retention we found. Sixty days, not ninety — customers who hit key milestones within 60 days retain at dramatically higher rates."

---

**Slide 5 — The Recommendation (3 minutes)**
Headline: _"Redesigning onboarding to drive 60-day milestone completion is our highest-leverage retention investment"_
Visual: Simple three-column table showing current state vs. proposed state vs. expected impact:

- Current: 90-day onboarding / 31% completion / 4-month median churn
- Proposed: 60-day milestone-driven onboarding / Target 65% completion / Projected churn reduction (TBD with modeled estimate)
- Impact: "If we move completion rate from 31% to 65%, and completion reduces churn 3x, we estimate [X]% improvement in net revenue retention" — CFO will want a number; prepare this calculation in advance.
  Verbal: "We're asking for authorization to begin an onboarding redesign project. The CS and Product teams have already aligned on the approach — we need executive sponsorship to prioritize the engineering resources to implement it."

---

**Slide 6 — Decision Slide (1 minute)**
Headline: _"We need one decision today: authorize the onboarding redesign project to begin in Q2"_
Content: Single bullet: "Decision requested: Approve onboarding redesign as a Q2 priority initiative." Below: Owner (CPO), timeline (90-day redesign), estimated investment ([figure]).
Verbal: "We're not asking for a blank check — we're asking for the project to be formally prioritized so the team can start scoping it this quarter."

---

**Anticipated Executive Challenges**

**Challenge 1 (CFO): "What's the revenue impact quantification?"**
Response: Prepare this before the meeting. Formula: (Current churned customers × 68% = value-realization churners) × ACV × churn reduction factor from 3x data. Present a conservative, base, and optimistic scenario. Say: "We've modeled three scenarios — conservative shows [X]. We can walk through the assumptions."

**Challenge 2 (CEO): "Why is onboarding completion only 31%?"**
Response: Be ready with root cause. Typical answers: onboarding is too long; there's no accountability between CS and the customer for milestone completion; customers don't understand what milestones matter. Have 2-3 specific examples from customer interviews ready as evidence.

**Challenge 3 (CPO): "How long will the redesign take and what resources do we need?"**
Response: Have a rough project estimate ready — don't make this up in the room. Recommended: align with CPO and engineering lead before the presentation to have a credible answer. "The CPO and I have discussed this — the redesign would take approximately 90 days with [X] engineering resources."
