## Overview

This prompt helps project managers coordinate external vendors and contractors by establishing structured deliverable tracking, contract milestone monitoring, vendor performance review processes, and escalation protocols for underperformance. It creates the governance framework needed to manage third-party delivery without micromanaging vendor teams.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Managing one or more external vendors contributing deliverables to a project with contractual milestone commitments
- A vendor relationship that is underperforming and needs structured performance management
- Setting up vendor governance at the start of a multi-vendor program to prevent coordination failures

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Contract negotiation or procurement strategy (use legal and procurement specialists)
- Internal team management where no contract or SLA governs the relationship
- Vendor selection and RFP evaluation processes

## Prompt

```
<role>You are a Senior Vendor Manager and Program Director with 14+ years of experience managing external vendor relationships on complex technology, professional services, and infrastructure programs. Deep expertise in deliverable acceptance criteria, contract milestone governance, vendor performance scorecards, SLA management, escalation protocols, and maintaining productive relationships while holding vendors accountable to commitments.</role>

<context>The user needs to set up or improve governance over one or more external vendors delivering project work. The goal is structured coordination that creates accountability without damaging the working relationship — ensuring vendors deliver on time, to quality standards, and within budget while the project manager has visibility to intervene before issues become crises.</context>

<input_handling>
Required: Vendor name(s) and their role in the project, key deliverables the vendor is responsible for, contract or project timeline
Optional: Current pain points with vendor performance, contract structure (fixed price, T&M, outcome-based), vendor team composition, existing escalation contacts, payment schedule linked to milestones
</input_handling>

<task>
1. Create a vendor deliverable register listing each contracted deliverable with its acceptance criteria, due date, payment linkage (if applicable), and delivery owner on both vendor and client sides
2. Design a vendor governance rhythm: standing meeting cadence, status report format, and milestone review protocol
3. Develop a vendor performance scorecard with 4-6 measurable criteria evaluated at each milestone
4. Define a tiered issue escalation protocol: what triggers each escalation level, who is involved, and what actions are taken
5. Draft a deliverable acceptance process: how deliverables are submitted, reviewed, accepted or rejected, and the turnaround time commitment from both sides
6. Identify vendor relationship risks: key person dependency, financial stability concerns, capacity conflicts, or communication breakdown patterns
7. Produce a vendor coordination summary the project manager can share with the vendor to align expectations
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Vendor coordination package with deliverable register, governance model, scorecard, escalation protocol
Length: 600-800 words
Include: Deliverable register table, weekly coordination agenda, performance scorecard criteria, escalation tiers, acceptance process, relationship risk flags, alignment summary
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent: Acceptance criteria are specific and measurable (not "deliverable meets requirements"); performance scorecard criteria are objective; escalation triggers are measurable thresholds not subjective judgments; relationship risks are named; vendor coordination feels collaborative not adversarial
Avoid: Acceptance criteria that require subjective interpretation; escalation protocols that skip straight to legal action; performance scorecards that only measure negatives; governance structures so heavy they consume more time than the work itself
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>Acceptance criteria must be verifiable without ambiguity. Escalation Level 1 must be resolved at the working team level before involving executives. Every deliverable must have a named client-side reviewer responsible for acceptance within a defined timeframe (maximum 5 business days).</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

"We hired TechBuild Solutions to develop the backend API for our new logistics platform. They're a 15-person consulting firm. The contract is $450K fixed price over 8 months. They have 5 developers on our project. Key deliverables: API design document, development environment setup, 3 API release packages (v0.1, v0.5, v1.0), integration test results, and final handover documentation. We're 2 months in and I'm worried they're behind — I'm not getting clear status updates."

### Output

**Vendor Coordination Package — TechBuild Solutions**
Project: Logistics Platform Backend API | Contract Value: $450K | Duration: 8 months

**Performance Scorecard**

Scored 1-5 at each milestone review (1=Unacceptable, 3=Meets Expectations, 5=Exceeds):

| Criteria              | Scoring Basis                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Schedule Adherence    | Deliverable delivered on or before due date                    |
| Quality — Technical   | Defect rate in acceptance testing vs. contracted threshold     |
| Communication         | Status reports submitted on time; proactive risk communication |
| Responsiveness        | Client questions answered within 1 business day                |
| Documentation Quality | Completeness and clarity of technical documentation            |
| Collaboration         | Active engagement in joint problem-solving; knowledge sharing  |

Minimum acceptable score: 3.0 average across all criteria. Score below 2.5 on any single criterion triggers a formal performance discussion.

**Escalation Protocol**

| Level              | Trigger                                                                                           | Action                                                                                 | Parties Involved                   | Timeframe                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| L1 — Working Level | Deliverable more than 5 business days late; status report missed twice                            | PM raises issue in weekly meeting; vendor provides written recovery plan within 3 days | PM + TechBuild Project Lead        | Resolve within 1 week                         |
| L2 — Management    | L1 not resolved in 1 week; pattern of missed commitments (2+ in a month); quality score below 2.5 | PM + TechBuild Delivery Manager meeting; formal issue notice sent in writing           | PM + TechBuild Delivery Manager    | Resolve within 2 weeks                        |
| L3 — Executive     | L2 not resolved in 2 weeks; deliverable more than 3 weeks late with no credible recovery plan     | Contract review; withhold next payment milestone until recovery plan approved          | Client PM Director + TechBuild CEO | Resolve within 2 weeks or invoke SLA remedies |

---

**Deliverable Acceptance Process**

1. TechBuild submits deliverable to client reviewer with a completion declaration checklist
2. Client reviewer has 5 business days to accept, reject, or request clarification
3. If rejected: specific deficiencies documented in writing within 5 days; TechBuild has 10 business days to remediate
4. Re-submission reviewed within 3 business days
5. Acceptance signed by designated client reviewer — payment release requested to finance

---

**Relationship Risk Flags**

- **Key Person Risk**: If TechBuild's lead architect leaves, API design continuity is at risk. Request that all architectural decisions be documented in ADR format (mitigates D-07 requirements simultaneously)
- **Communication Breakdown (Current)**: Unclear status updates in months 1-2 may indicate the project is behind. Immediate action: request a current burn rate and % complete report for D-01 and D-02 before the next weekly meeting

## Variations

- **Multi-Vendor Coordination**: Framework for managing 3+ vendors delivering interdependent workstreams on a single program
- **Offshore Vendor Adaptation**: Modified governance model accounting for time zone differences and asynchronous coordination patterns
