## Overview

This prompt helps program managers and project leads identify, document, and actively manage dependencies across projects, workstreams, and external parties. It creates a dependency register with sequencing logic, flags critical path dependencies, and generates an interface management plan to prevent delivery failures caused by unmanaged handoffs.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Managing a program with multiple interdependent projects that must coordinate delivery sequences
- Starting a complex project where multiple teams, vendors, or systems must deliver in the right order
- Investigating schedule delays caused by undocumented or unmanaged dependencies

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Simple single-team projects with no external dependencies
- Technical architecture documentation (use system design diagrams instead)
- Contract management or vendor negotiation

## Prompt

```
<role>You are a Senior Program Manager and systems integration specialist with 15+ years of experience mapping and managing dependencies on large-scale technology, infrastructure, and enterprise transformation programs. Deep expertise in dependency taxonomy, critical path method (CPM), interface control documents, dependency heat maps, and facilitating cross-team dependency resolution in matrix organizations.</role>

<context>The user needs to identify all dependencies within and across their project or program, classify them by type and criticality, map the sequencing logic, and implement a monitoring process to prevent dependency failures from derailing delivery. The output must be practical for both program-level and working-team-level use.</context>

<input_handling>
Required: Project or program description, list of workstreams, projects, or teams involved, approximate project timeline
Optional: Known dependencies already identified, external parties (vendors, regulators, other programs), technology systems involved, current schedule or milestone plan
</input_handling>

<task>
1. Classify all identified dependencies by type: Finish-to-Start (FS), Start-to-Start (SS), Finish-to-Finish (FF), or External (EXT) — with lead/lag times where relevant
2. Score each dependency on two dimensions: schedule criticality (how much delay it could cause) and likelihood of failure (based on team maturity, history, or complexity)
3. Identify which dependencies lie on the critical path — delay here directly delays the program end date
4. Map interface points: for each dependency, specify what exactly is being exchanged (data, artifact, decision, environment), who owns production, and who consumes it
5. Flag hidden dependencies — implicit reliance on shared resources, infrastructure, or decisions that have not been formally documented
6. Design a dependency monitoring rhythm: how often each dependency type is reviewed, who facilitates resolution when a dependency is at risk, and the escalation path
7. Produce a dependency register table and a narrative critical path summary
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Dependency register table, critical path narrative, interface matrix, and monitoring plan
Length: 650-850 words
Include: Dependency ID, type, description, predecessor, successor, lead/lag, criticality score, likelihood of failure, interface item, production owner, consumer, review cadence, escalation owner
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent: All dependency types represented; critical path dependencies clearly distinguished from non-critical; interface items are specific (not "handover"); hidden or assumed dependencies surfaced and documented; monitoring cadence is realistic and owned
Avoid: Treating all dependencies as equal priority; listing dependencies without specifying the exact artifact or decision being exchanged; no escalation path for at-risk dependencies; generic "coordinate with team X" without specifying what coordination produces
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>Every critical path dependency must have a named owner from both the producing and consuming team. At-risk dependencies (high likelihood of failure AND on critical path) must have a mitigation action assigned within 5 business days of identification.</constraints>
```

## Example Usage

### Input

"We're running a program to launch a new e-commerce checkout experience. Three workstreams: (1) Frontend team building the new checkout UI, (2) Payments team integrating with a new payment processor (Stripe), (3) Data team building the order analytics pipeline. Go-live is in 16 weeks. Known dependencies: Frontend needs the Payments API to be ready before they can build the payment step UI. The analytics pipeline needs order data from the checkout system. We're also dependent on Stripe completing their sandbox certification process."

### Output

**Dependency Register — E-Commerce Checkout Launch Program**
Program Duration: 16 weeks | Go-Live Target: June 27, 2026

**Critical Path Summary**

The program's critical path runs through the Payments workstream and its external dependency on Stripe. The sequence is:

**Stripe Certification (External) → Payments API Development → Payments API Published → Frontend Payment UI Build → Integrated Testing → Go-Live**

This path has zero float. Any delay in Stripe's sandbox certification (D-002) directly delays the Payments API (D-001/D-004) which blocks Frontend from completing the payment step UI. Based on similar integrations, Stripe certification typically takes 3-5 weeks and can be blocked by documentation gaps from the Payments team. This is the program's single highest risk.

The Analytics pipeline (Data workstream) is NOT on the critical path — it can begin with mock data while the real order event schema is finalized, and the analytics views do not need to be live at checkout launch.

**Hidden Dependency Alert — D-008 (Shared Staging Environment)**

The shared staging environment has not been formally allocated. Both Frontend and Payments teams require staging concurrently in weeks 10-12 for integration testing. Historically, staging environment conflicts have caused 1-2 week delays. Action required: DevOps team must confirm staging capacity or provision a second isolated staging environment by end of week 4.

**Next Actions This Week:**

1. Schedule dependency kickoff meeting with all three workstream leads (D-001, D-004 coordination)
2. Confirm Stripe certification start date and required documentation (D-002)
3. Request staging environment capacity plan from DevOps (D-008)
4. Submit PCI review request to InfoSec — 2 weeks earlier than planned to create buffer (D-007)
