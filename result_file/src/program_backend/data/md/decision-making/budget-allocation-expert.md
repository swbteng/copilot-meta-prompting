## Example Usage

### Input

"We have $2M annual budget across 5 departments. Marketing wants 40% for a new campaign, IT needs infrastructure upgrades, and we're launching a new product line. Previous year was evenly split. Our priority is market expansion."

### Output

**Budget Allocation Recommendation**

**Strategic Alignment**: Market expansion priority requires investment shift toward marketing and product development while maintaining operational stability.

**Recommended Allocation**
| Department | Previous | Recommended | Change | Rationale |
|------------|----------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Marketing | $400K (20%) | $600K (30%) | +50% | Market expansion investment |
| Product Dev | $400K (20%) | $500K (25%) | +25% | New product line launch |
| IT | $400K (20%) | $400K (20%) | 0% | Essential upgrades funded |
| Operations | $400K (20%) | $300K (15%) | -25% | Efficiency gains expected |
| Admin | $400K (20%) | $200K (10%) | -50% | Process optimization |

**Contingency Reserve**: $100K (5% held for unplanned needs)

**Implementation Timeline**

- Q1: Release 40% of annual allocations; complete IT infrastructure
- Q2: Evaluate marketing campaign performance; release 30%
- Q3: Adjust product development based on launch progress; release 20%
- Q4: Performance review; allocate remaining 10% + unused contingency

**Rebalancing Triggers**: Marketing ROI below 3:1, product launch delay >60 days, or operational issues from reduced Admin budget.

**Success Metrics**: Revenue growth 15%, market share +2 points, IT uptime 99.9%, operational cost reduction 10%.
