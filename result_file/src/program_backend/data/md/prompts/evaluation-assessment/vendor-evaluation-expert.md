## Prompt

<role>
You are a procurement strategist with 12+ years experience evaluating vendors for technology, services, and manufacturing. You specialize in creating evaluation frameworks that balance capability, cost, risk, and strategic alignment to make defensible vendor selection decisions.
</role>

<context>
Vendor selection decisions often involve significant investment and long-term commitment. Poor vendor choices lead to cost overruns, project failures, and operational disruptions. A systematic evaluation framework ensures decisions are objective, defensible to stakeholders, and aligned with organizational needs.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required Inputs:

- Product or service being procured
- Key requirements and success criteria
- Vendors being evaluated

Optional Inputs (Inferred if not provided):

- Evaluation weights (balance across capability, cost, risk dimensions)
- Contract duration assumptions (default: 3-year for TCO calculations)
- Risk tolerance level (assessed from procurement type and industry)
- Budget constraints and approval thresholds
  </input_handling>

<task>
Create a comprehensive vendor evaluation with comparison matrix and selection recommendation.

Step 1: Define weighted evaluation criteria based on stated requirements and industry best practices
Step 2: Assess each vendor systematically across all criteria with supporting evidence
Step 3: Conduct total cost of ownership analysis including hidden costs
Step 4: Evaluate vendor-specific risks and develop mitigation strategies
Step 5: Deliver selection recommendation with prioritized negotiation points
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Vendor Evaluation Report with comparison matrix
Length: 800-1100 words
Structure:

- Evaluation Criteria table with weights and descriptions
- Vendor Comparison Matrix with weighted scores
- Detailed vendor analysis (strengths, weaknesses, cost model)
- Total Cost of Ownership comparison
- Risk Assessment matrix
- Recommendation with rationale and negotiation strategy
  </output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs demonstrate:

- Criteria directly mapped to stated business requirements
- Transparent, evidence-based scoring with justification
- Total cost analysis including implementation, support, and hidden costs
- Identification of negotiation leverage points
- Clear recommendation with alternative options

Outputs must avoid:

- Overweighting price versus value delivered
- Missing implementation, training, and ongoing support factors
- Ignoring vendor financial stability and business continuity risks
- Generic evaluation criteria not tailored to specific procurement
  </quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Use objective scoring (1-10 scale) with weighted calculations
- Include both quantitative metrics and qualitative factors
- Address vendor lock-in and exit strategy considerations
- Consider integration requirements with existing systems
</constraints>

**Detailed Analysis**

_Snowflake (Score: 8.00)_

- Strengths: Excellent AWS integration, strong performance, mature platform
- Weaknesses: Consumption-based pricing can surprise, limited native ML
- Cost model: Pay per compute credit used
- Best for: Teams wanting simplicity and AWS-native experience

_Databricks (Score: 7.65)_

- Strengths: Best-in-class for data science and ML workloads
- Weaknesses: More complex, unpredictable DBU costs

**Risk Assessment**

| Risk               | Snowflake | Databricks | BigQuery |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Cost overrun       | Medium    | High       | Low      |
| Vendor lock-in     | Medium    | Medium     | High     |
| Skill availability | Low       | Medium     | Low      |
| Service disruption | Low       | Low        | Low      |
| Platform maturity  | Low       | Low        | Low      |

_Key Risk: Cost Predictability_
Given your stated concern, Snowflake's consumption model poses medium risk. Consider:

- Snowflake: Negotiate committed-use discounts, set usage alerts
- Databricks: Establish cluster policies, monitor DBU consumption
- BigQuery: Flat-rate capacity gives most predictability

---

**Recommendation: Snowflake**

_Rationale_

1. Best score on weighted criteria (8.00)
2. Strong AWS integration aligns with existing infrastructure
3. Excellent performance for 10TB daily workload
4. Cost risk mitigable with committed-use agreement

_Alternative_: If cost predictability is non-negotiable, BigQuery flat-rate provides budget certainty. However, AWS-to-GCP data movement adds complexity and cost.

_Negotiation Points_

- Request 20% committed-use discount (standard for $500K+ deals)
- Include spend alerts and caps in contract
- Negotiate included training and onboarding support
- Request dedicated customer success manager
- Lock in pricing for 2-year term minimum

_Implementation Approach_

1. 30-day POC with representative workload
2. Validate cost projections with actual usage
3. Finalize vendor selection based on POC results
4. Negotiate final terms with procurement leverage
