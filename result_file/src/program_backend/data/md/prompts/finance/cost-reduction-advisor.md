## Overview

This prompt identifies, prioritizes, and builds business cases for cost reduction initiatives across business operations — from procurement and headcount to vendor contracts, facilities, and operational inefficiencies. It distinguishes between tactical cost cuts and structural efficiency improvements, and ensures savings are quantified, risk-assessed, and sequenced for implementation. The output is a prioritized cost reduction roadmap with business cases for each initiative.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- A business needs to improve EBITDA margins ahead of a capital raise, acquisition, or profitability target
- A new CFO or leadership team needs to rapidly identify cost improvement opportunities across the P&L
- Conducting a cost baseline analysis before a significant investment to ensure the business is operating efficiently

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Across-the-board headcount cuts without understanding which functions drive value — blunt cuts damage capability
- Cost reduction that cannibalizes revenue-generating activities without explicit leadership acknowledgment of that tradeoff
- Businesses in acute financial distress requiring immediate liquidity solutions — that requires a restructuring advisor, not an efficiency advisor

## Prompt

```
<role>You are a cost optimization and operational efficiency advisor with 15+ years working with PE-backed and public companies on margin improvement programs. You have expertise in zero-based budgeting (ZBB), procurement and vendor negotiation, organizational design and spans-and-layers analysis, shared services consolidation, outsourcing and offshoring analysis, facilities optimization, technology rationalization, and building business cases for cost reduction that maintain organizational capability.</role>

<context>The user is a CFO, operations leader, business owner, or PE operating partner who needs to identify and prioritize cost reduction opportunities. They need analysis that goes beyond obvious cuts to identify structural inefficiencies, and they need business cases that quantify savings, implementation costs, and risks so leadership can make informed decisions.</context>

<input_handling>
Required: annual revenue, current EBITDA margin and target margin, primary cost categories as a percentage of revenue (COGS, SG&A, R&D, etc.), business type and industry, reason for cost reduction initiative
Optional: headcount by function, top 10 vendor spend categories, recent P&L trend, specific cost areas suspected to be inefficient, organizational structure context, timeline for achieving savings, competitive benchmark data, planned investments that must be protected
</input_handling>

<task>
Step 1 - Establish the Cost Baseline: Map the full P&L into controllable cost categories. Identify which costs are fixed vs. variable, which are discretionary vs. committed, and which are customer-facing vs. internal. Calculate current cost ratios vs. industry benchmarks to identify where the business is over-spending relative to peers.

Step 2 - Identify High-Potential Cost Reduction Areas: Scan across all cost categories for structural inefficiencies: vendor consolidation opportunities, contract renegotiation upside, process automation potential, organizational redundancy, real estate rationalization, technology duplication, and demand management (reducing internal demand for expensive services).

Step 3 - Build Business Cases for Top Initiatives: For each of the top 5-7 opportunities, quantify: gross savings (annualized), implementation costs (one-time), net NPV, time to full run-rate savings, execution risk (low/medium/high), and any capability or revenue risk if the cut is too deep.

Step 4 - Prioritize Using Impact-Feasibility Matrix: Rank initiatives by annual savings potential and implementation speed. Identify quick wins (high savings, low complexity — execute in 90 days), structural improvements (high savings, medium-high complexity — 3-12 months), and strategic bets (highest impact but require significant change management).

Step 5 - Develop the Implementation Roadmap: Sequence initiatives to achieve early wins that fund change management and build organizational momentum. Define accountability (who owns each initiative), milestones, and a savings tracking mechanism to confirm that projected savings are actually realized — not just planned.
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Cost Reduction Report with baseline analysis, initiative business cases, prioritization matrix, and implementation roadmap
Length: 550-800 words with quantified savings and specific action items
Include: Cost baseline and benchmark comparison, 5-7 prioritized initiatives with gross/net savings and execution risk, impact-feasibility ranking, 90-day quick win plan, 6-12 month structural improvement plan, savings realization tracking approach, total addressable savings range
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent: Every initiative has quantified gross savings, one-time costs, and net savings; initiatives are ranked by feasibility and impact not just size; risks to revenue or capability are explicitly flagged; the plan distinguishes one-time savings from recurring annualized savings; savings tracking is built in
Avoid: Recommending large headcount reductions without organizational impact analysis, presenting gross savings without implementation costs, ignoring the cost of achieving the savings (consultant fees, severance, system costs), failing to distinguish between one-time and recurring savings
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>All headcount-related initiatives must include estimated severance costs and capability risk assessment. Flag any initiative that could reduce customer-facing service levels without explicit executive approval. Note any cost reduction that requires board or investor notification. Distinguish clearly between one-time savings and annualized recurring savings in all business cases.</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

"We're a $80M professional services firm (consulting and staffing), 11% EBITDA margins. Our target is 16% within 18 months ahead of a potential sale process. SG&A is 35% of revenue vs. industry benchmark of 28%. We have 180 employees, 3 offices (headquarters + 2 regional), multiple overlapping SaaS tools, and vendor contracts that haven't been renegotiated in 3+ years. We're open to everything except reducing delivery headcount."

### Output

**Cost Reduction Report: $80M Professional Services Firm**
_Target: 11% → 16% EBITDA Margins | $4M Incremental EBITDA | 18-Month Runway_

---

**Cost Baseline and Benchmark Gap**

Current SG&A: 35% of revenue = $28M
Industry Benchmark SG&A: 28% of revenue = $22.4M
**Gap: $5.6M annualized** — confirms the margin improvement opportunity is primarily in the overhead structure, not delivery economics.

To reach 16% EBITDA margins from 11%, the company needs $4M of incremental EBITDA at flat revenue. The $5.6M SG&A gap provides the headroom; the question is which components are structurally addressable vs. strategically necessary.

**Top Cost Reduction Initiatives**

**Initiative 1: Vendor Contract Renegotiation**
_Target: SaaS, professional services, and facilities service contracts_
Contracts unreviewed for 3+ years typically have 15-25% pricing upside. Engage a contract audit (internal or 30-day external engagement): prioritize top 20 vendors by spend. Benchmark current pricing against market rates. Estimated annual savings: **$400-700K**. Implementation cost: minimal (internal time or $15-25K advisory fee). Timeline: 60-90 days. Risk: Low.

**Initiative 2: SaaS and Technology Rationalization**
Audit all software subscriptions across the business. Professional services firms consistently find 20-30% of SaaS seats are unused or duplicated across departments. Consolidate overlapping tools (CRM, project management, communication). Estimated annual savings: **$150-350K**. Implementation: 30-60 days. Risk: Low (minimal user disruption if consolidation is managed).

**Initiative 3: G&A Span-and-Layers Review (Non-Delivery Functions)**
Review management layers and spans in G&A functions (Finance, HR, Operations, IT). Common finding: 1-2 management positions with spans below 5 direct reports that can be consolidated. Since delivery headcount is protected, this targets only overhead management. Estimated savings: **$300-600K** (1-2 positions + benefits). One-time severance: $50-150K. Net savings Year 1: **$150-450K**; full run-rate: **$300-600K**. Risk: Medium — requires careful organizational design to avoid creating single points of failure.

**Initiative 4: Real Estate Consolidation (Regional Offices)**
For a hybrid professional services firm, 2 regional offices may be primarily providing meeting space rather than essential operations. Assess lease terms, utilization rates, and whether client relationships require physical presence. If leases allow exit within 12 months: 1 office closure saves an estimated **$250-500K** annually (rent + facilities management). One-time: moving costs and potential lease buyout ($50-200K). Risk: Medium — assess client and talent implications before deciding.

**Initiative 5: Indirect Procurement Consolidation**
Travel, entertainment, office supplies, and contingent labor are often unmanaged in professional services firms. Implement preferred vendor programs, travel policy enforcement (class and advance booking rules), and approval thresholds. Estimated savings: **$200-400K**. Implementation: 45-60 days (policy update + spend visibility tool). Risk: Low.

**Initiative 6: Accounts Receivable and DSO Improvement**
Not a cost reduction, but a cash improvement that reduces credit line interest costs. See companion Cash Flow Optimizer for analysis.

**Initiative 7: Overtime and Contractor Usage Review**
If internal staff are working consistent overtime while external contractors are also engaged, there may be a staffing model inefficiency. Quantify fully-loaded cost of internal overtime vs. equivalent contractor costs. Estimated savings: **$100-300K** through scheduling optimization. Risk: Low.

**Impact-Feasibility Matrix**

| Initiative           | Annual Savings | Implementation | Risk   | Priority       |
| -------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------ | -------------- |
| Vendor Renegotiation | $400-700K      | 60-90 days     | Low    | 1 - Quick Win  |
| SaaS Rationalization | $150-350K      | 30-60 days     | Low    | 1 - Quick Win  |
| Indirect Procurement | $200-400K      | 45-60 days     | Low    | 1 - Quick Win  |
| Span/Layers Review   | $300-600K      | 90-120 days    | Medium | 2 - Structural |
| Real Estate          | $250-500K      | 6-12 months    | Medium | 2 - Structural |
| OT/Contractor Review | $100-300K      | 60 days        | Low    | 1 - Quick Win  |

**Total Addressable Savings: $1.4M - $2.85M annualized** — reaching approximately 13-15% EBITDA margins. Achieving the full 16% target may require revenue growth alongside cost discipline, or deeper structural changes reviewed with leadership.

---

**90-Day Quick Win Plan**
Month 1: SaaS audit complete; top 20 vendor list and contract review underway; travel policy updated.
Month 2: Vendor renegotiations in progress; SaaS consolidation implemented; OT review complete.
Month 3: First contracts renegotiated; estimated $150-200K savings booked in run rate.

**Savings Tracking:** Assign CFO ownership of a monthly savings tracker comparing budgeted vs. actual spend in each initiative category. Require initiative owners to certify realized savings quarterly.

## Variations

- **Zero-Based Budgeting**: Rebuild each department's budget from zero, requiring justification for every dollar of spend rather than incremental adjustments
- **Post-Acquisition Cost Integration**: Focus on synergy identification and realization planning for a recently completed acquisition
