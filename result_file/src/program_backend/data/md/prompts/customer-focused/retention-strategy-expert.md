## Example Usage

### Input

"We're a B2B SaaS company with $200/month average subscription. We're seeing 8% monthly churn, mainly from small businesses. Customers who stay past 90 days rarely leave, but early churn is killing us. We have 2 customer success managers for 1000 accounts."

### Output

**Churn Risk Segmentation**

| Risk Level | Indicators                                             | % of Base | Intervention                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Critical   | No login 14+ days in first 90 days, support complaint  | 8%        | Personal outreach within 24 hours |
| High       | Declining usage trend, single user, no integrations    | 20%       | Automated campaign + CSM review   |
| Medium     | Using <50% of features, no expansion activity          | 35%       | Educational content sequence      |
| Healthy    | Regular usage, team collaboration, integrations active | 37%       | Quarterly check-in, upsell focus  |

**Early Warning Signals** (First 90 Days Critical)

- Days 1-7: No first key action completed
- Days 8-14: No second login after initial setup
- Days 15-30: Usage declining from week 1 baseline
- Days 30-60: Single user with no team invites

**Critical Risk Playbook**

- Trigger: Risk score enters "Critical" zone
- Day 0: CSM personal email with calendar link, offer consultation
- Day 2: If no response, phone call attempt
- Day 4: Email from executive with "How can we help?" framing
- Day 7: Offer 30-day free extension to complete setup properly
- Follow-up: Weekly until stable or churned

**Value Reinforcement Program**

- Monthly: Usage summary email showing activity and features used
- Day 60: "Success check-in" from CSM for accounts in first 90 days
- Day 85: Renewal preparation with ROI summary
- Ongoing: Feature announcement emails based on unused capabilities

**Cancellation Flow**

1. Capture reason (required dropdown + optional comment)
2. Offer pause option (3 months hold vs. cancel)
3. If proceeding: Confirm and schedule exit interview
4. Win-back sequence: Day 30, 60, 90 post-churn

**Success Metrics**: Reduce monthly churn from 8% to 5.5% within 6 months. Track 90-day retention rate (target: 85%), intervention response rate, and win-back rate (target: 15% of churned customers).
