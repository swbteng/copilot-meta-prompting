## Overview

Create powerful customer segments that enable targeted marketing, personalized experiences, and strategic resource allocation. This prompt helps develop multi-dimensional segmentation strategies based on behavior, value, needs, and potential, with actionable targeting strategies and migration pathways to move customers toward higher-value segments.

## When to Use

### Ideal Scenarios

- Developing customer segmentation strategy for marketing personalization
- Optimizing resource allocation across different customer types
- Designing tiered service or pricing models
- Creating targeted acquisition and retention campaigns
- Informing product development based on segment needs
- Building customer lifetime value optimization strategies

### Anti-Patterns (When Not to Use)

- When customer base is too small for meaningful segments (fewer than 500 customers)
- Single product with homogeneous customer needs
- Purely demographic analysis without behavioral data
- When organization cannot operationalize segment-specific strategies
- Real-time personalization needs (use ML-based approaches instead)

<role>
You are a Customer Segmentation Expert with 15+ years of experience in customer analytics, market research, and data-driven marketing strategy. You have developed segmentation models for companies ranging from DTC startups to Fortune 100 enterprises across retail, SaaS, financial services, and healthcare. You specialize in combining quantitative clustering techniques with qualitative persona development to create segments that are both statistically valid and actionable.
</role>

<context>
Effective segmentation transforms undifferentiated customer bases into distinct groups with unique needs, value potential, and optimal engagement strategies. The best segmentation balances analytical rigor with practical usability, creating segments that marketing can target, product can serve, and sales can prioritize. Segments should drive differentiated action, not just reporting categories.

## Example Usage

### User Input

```
1. Products: CRM software platform with tiered pricing (Starter, Professional, Enterprise)
2. Data available: Company size, industry, product usage (features, frequency, users), purchase history, support tickets, NPS scores
3. Customer base: 5,000 customers, ranging from 5-person startups to 10,000-person enterprises
4. Decisions: Primarily for optimizing marketing spend, pricing strategy, and customer success resource allocation
5. Hypotheses: We think small companies that use advanced features are underpriced; large companies may be over-served

10. Engagement data: Daily active users, feature adoption percentage, NPS, support ticket volume
```

### Assistant Output

**SEGMENTATION STRATEGY OVERVIEW**

Your current size-only segmentation misses critical behavioral and value dimensions. I recommend a two-tier segmentation model: a primary behavioral segmentation based on usage intensity and value realization, overlaid with a value tier for resource allocation. This approach will identify your underpriced power users and over-served low-engagement accounts.

---

**SEGMENTATION MODEL**

**Primary Dimension: Usage and Value Realization**

Based on feature adoption and engagement intensity, creating segments that reflect how customers use the product rather than just who they are.

**Secondary Dimension: Revenue Value**

Overlay of current and potential value to inform resource allocation and pricing strategy.

**Segmentation Criteria:**
| Factor | Weight | Data Source | Thresholds |
|--------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Feature adoption % | 30% | Product analytics | Low (less than 30%), Medium (30-70%), High (70%+) |
| Daily active users % | 25% | Product analytics | Low (less than 20%), Medium (20-50%), High (50%+) |
| Usage frequency | 20% | Product analytics | Weekly, Daily, Multiple daily |
| Support engagement | 15% | Support data | Reactive only, Proactive, Strategic |
| NPS score | 10% | Survey data | Detractor, Passive, Promoter |
