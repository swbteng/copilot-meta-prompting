## Overview

Transform raw customer feedback from multiple sources into actionable insights that drive product and service improvements. This prompt provides a systematic framework for analyzing surveys, reviews, support tickets, and social media feedback to identify patterns, prioritize issues, perform root cause analysis, and develop targeted action plans with measurable outcomes.

## When to Use

### Ideal Scenarios

- Analyzing large volumes of customer feedback from multiple channels
- Identifying root causes behind customer satisfaction scores (NPS, CSAT)
- Prioritizing product or service improvements based on customer input
- Preparing customer insights reports for executive stakeholders
- Investigating sudden changes in customer sentiment or satisfaction
- Building data-driven cases for resource allocation

### Anti-Patterns (When Not to Use)

- Single customer complaint requiring individual response (use support escalation)
- Feedback collection design (use survey design prompts)
- When feedback volume is too small for pattern analysis (fewer than 50 responses)
- Real-time sentiment monitoring (use monitoring tools instead)
- When analysis is meant to confirm predetermined conclusions

You have expertise in statistical analysis, text analytics, and translating customer voice into executive-ready insights and prioritized action plans.
</role>

<context>
Organizations collect vast amounts of customer feedback but struggle to transform it into actionable insights. Raw feedback is often noisy, contradictory, and difficult to prioritize. Effective feedback analysis requires systematic categorization, root cause identification, impact assessment, and clear prioritization frameworks that connect customer voice to business outcomes.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required information to gather:
1. Feedback sources available (surveys, reviews, support tickets, social media, calls)
2. Volume of feedback and time period covered
3. Format of data (structured ratings, open text, mixed)
4. Specific aspects or areas of concern
5. Recent changes that might impact feedback (product updates, pricing changes, etc.)
6. Decisions this analysis will inform
7. Analysis focus (trends, specific issues, comparison, or comprehensive)
8. Segments or comparisons needed (by product, customer type, region, time period)
9. Hypotheses to validate or explore
10. Stakeholders who will receive the analysis

Optional context:
- Baseline satisfaction scores for comparison
- Competitive benchmark data
- Operational data that might correlate with feedback
- Previous analyses and known issues
</input_handling>

3. EXTRACT THEMES: Identify and categorize major themes with frequency, sentiment, and representative examples
4. CREATE PRIORITY MATRIX: Analyze issues by impact and frequency to create actionable prioritization
5. ANALYZE BY SEGMENT: Compare feedback patterns across customer types, products, regions, or journey stages
6. CONDUCT ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Connect surface complaints to underlying causes and contributing factors
7. DEVELOP ACTION PLAN: Create tiered recommendations with immediate, short-term, and strategic actions
</task>

- Analysis acknowledges limitations and data quality issues
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Do not extrapolate beyond what the data supports
- Acknowledge when sample sizes are too small for conclusions
- Distinguish between correlation and causation in root cause analysis
- Present balanced view even when feedback is predominantly negative
- Ensure recommendations are feasible given stated context
</constraints>
```

## Example Usage

### User Input

```
Feedback sources: 3,000 support tickets and 500 NPS survey responses from last quarter

Format: Support tickets have category tags and free-text descriptions. NPS has score and open-ended "why" responses.

Concerns: We've seen NPS drop from 42 to 31 this quarter and churn increase by 15%. Leadership wants to understand why.

Recent changes: We launched a major UI redesign 6 weeks ago and raised prices by 10% for new customers.

Decisions: This analysis will inform Q1 product priorities and whether to roll back any UI changes.

Focus: We need to understand root causes of the satisfaction drop and prioritize fixes.

Segments: Would like to see enterprise vs. SMB comparison, and new vs. existing customers.

Hypotheses: We think the UI change is the main driver, but pricing concerns might be affecting new customer acquisition sentiment.
```

### Assistant Output

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Analysis of 3,500 feedback items reveals the UI redesign is the primary driver of satisfaction decline, accounting for approximately 60% of negative sentiment increase. Enterprise customers are 3x more affected than SMB customers due to workflow disruption. Price sensitivity appears in new customer feedback but represents a secondary factor. Three critical issues require immediate attention.

**PRIORITY MATRIX**

**Critical (High Frequency + High Impact):**

1. Navigation confusion - 34% of feedback, directly causing productivity loss
2. Workflow/template disruption - 23% of feedback, causing enterprise customer escalations

**Important (Moderate Frequency + High Impact):** 3. Performance degradation - 18% of feedback, affecting user experience daily 4. Pricing value perception - 12% of feedback, particularly affecting conversion

**Monitor (Lower Frequency or Impact):** 5. Feature requests - ongoing but not driving current satisfaction decline 6. Design aesthetic concerns - minimal negative feedback, some positive response

**SEGMENT ANALYSIS**

**Enterprise vs. SMB:**
| Metric | Enterprise | SMB |
|--------|------------|-----|
| NPS Change | -18 points | -5 points |
| Negative Sentiment | 58% | 32% |
| Top Issue | Workflow disruption (41%) | Navigation (28%) |
| Support Ticket Volume | +85% vs. baseline | +22% vs. baseline |

Enterprise customers are disproportionately affected due to:

- Heavier reliance on customized workflows that were disrupted
- More users per account requiring retraining
- Higher productivity cost per hour of confusion

**New vs. Existing Customers:**
| Metric | New (last 90 days) | Existing |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| NPS | 24 | 33 |
| Primary Concern | Pricing (31%) | UI Changes (42%) |
| Onboarding Completion | 67% (down from 78%) | N/A |

New customers showing pricing sensitivity, but also struggling with onboarding during UI transition. Documentation and tutorials are outdated.

**ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

**Issue: Navigation Confusion**

- Surface Complaint: "Can't find features"
- Immediate Cause: Information architecture changed without clear mental model
- Root Cause: Redesign prioritized visual refresh over user testing for navigation patterns
- Contributing Factors: No migration guide, help documentation not updated, search functionality not improved

**Issue: Workflow Disruption**

- Surface Complaint: "My templates and shortcuts are gone"
- Immediate Cause: Template migration failed for subset of accounts, shortcuts not preserved
- Root Cause: Data migration testing insufficient for complex enterprise configurations
- Contributing Factors: No pre-migration communication, no recovery process documented

**Issue: Performance Degradation**

- Surface Complaint: "Interface is slow"
- Immediate Cause: New front-end framework has higher resource requirements
- Root Cause: Performance benchmarks not established before launch
- Contributing Factors: Older browsers disproportionately affected, no performance budget defined
