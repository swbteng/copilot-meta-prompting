## Example Usage

### Input

"Hiring a Senior Software Engineer. Three finalists: A has great technical skills but seems introverted, B is a strong communicator with less experience, C has everything but is 20% above our budget."

### Output

**Hiring Decision Analysis**

**Evaluation Criteria**
| Criteria | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Technical Skills | 35% | Coding ability, system design, problem-solving |
| Experience Relevance | 25% | Years in similar role, domain knowledge |
| Communication | 15% | Clarity, collaboration, documentation |
| Growth Potential | 15% | Learning ability, ambition, adaptability |
| Team Fit | 10% | Working style, values alignment |

**Candidate Comparison**
| Criteria | Weight | Candidate A | Candidate B | Candidate C |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Technical | 35% | 9/10 (3.15) | 6/10 (2.10) | 9/10 (3.15) |
| Experience | 25% | 8/10 (2.00) | 5/10 (1.25) | 8/10 (2.00) |
| Communication | 15% | 6/10 (0.90) | 9/10 (1.35) | 8/10 (1.20) |

| **Total** | 100% | **7.80** | **6.70** | **8.20** |

**Deep Dive: Top Candidates**

_Candidate C (Score: 8.20)_

- Strengths: Complete package - technical depth, experience, communicates well
- Concern: 20% above budget ($150K vs $125K target)
- Risk: May leave if not compensated fairly; creates equity issues
- Mitigation: Negotiate signing bonus instead of base increase; accelerated review

_Candidate A (Score: 7.80)_

- Strengths: Exceptional technical skills, 8 years experience
- Concern: Introverted - may struggle in collaborative environment
- Assessment: References confirm strong async communication, pair programming skills
- Risk: Moderate - introversion is style, not inability to collaborate

**Recommendation: Candidate C with Compensation Negotiation**

_Rationale_: Strongest overall candidate with lowest risk. Budget stretch justified by reduced ramp-up time and immediate senior-level contribution.

_Negotiation Approach_:

- Offer $130K base (4% above budget)
- $10K signing bonus
- 6-month performance review for salary adjustment

_Alternative_: If C declines, proceed with A - technical strength is most critical, and introversion is manageable with right team dynamics.

**Onboarding Focus**: For either hire, pair with senior team member for first month, assign cross-functional project by month 2.
