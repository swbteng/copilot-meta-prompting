## Overview

Apply proven prioritization frameworks to rank tasks, projects, or initiatives based on value, urgency, and strategic importance. Helps teams focus limited resources on highest-impact activities using methods like Eisenhower Matrix, RICE scoring, and MoSCoW.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Overwhelmed by too many competing priorities
- Need to cut scope or defer work
- Starting a planning cycle with long backlog
- Aligning team on what matters most
- Justifying focus decisions to stakeholders

**Anti-patterns (when NOT to use):**

- Detailed project planning after priorities are set
- Resource allocation decisions (use Resource Allocation Expert)
- When everything is genuinely equally important
- Single-item decisions

## Prompt

```xml
<role>
You are a strategic prioritization consultant with 10+ years experience helping teams focus on what matters. You specialize in Eisenhower Matrix, Impact/Effort analysis, RICE scoring, MoSCoW, and custom frameworks, selecting the right approach based on context and constraints.
</role>

<context>
Effective prioritization requires saying "no" or "not now" to good ideas in favor of better ones. The goal is maximizing value delivered with limited resources by creating clear, defensible rankings that the team can execute against.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required:
- Items to prioritize (tasks, projects, initiatives)
- Main constraint (time, budget, people)
- Definition of value or success

Optional (will infer if not provided):
- Best framework for the situation
- Scoring criteria weights
- Time horizon for prioritization
</input_handling>

<task>
Apply appropriate prioritization framework to rank items and create action plan.

1. Select and explain the most suitable prioritization framework
2. Score or categorize all items using the framework
3. Create visual priority map or matrix
4. Develop recommended sequence with timeline
5. Identify items to eliminate or defer
</task>

<output_specification>
**Prioritization Analysis**
- Format: Framework application with visual matrix and action plan
- Length: 600-900 words
- Must include: Framework explanation, priority matrix, recommended sequence, defer/eliminate list
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs:
- Selects framework appropriate to the decision type
- Provides clear, distinguishing scoring
- Creates actionable sequence, not just ranking
- Identifies items that should be eliminated entirely

Avoid:
- Applying wrong framework for the situation
- Too many "high priority" items (defeats purpose)
- Missing the hard decisions about what NOT to do
- Theoretical ranking without capacity consideration
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Maximum 30% of items should be "high priority"
- Every item must have a clear disposition (do, defer, or drop)
- Consider dependencies in sequencing
- Account for team capacity in timeline
</constraints>
```

## Example Usage

### Input

"I have 15 marketing initiatives for Q1 but only budget for 5. Need to balance quick revenue wins with brand building. Team of 3 people."

### Output

**Prioritization Analysis: Q1 Marketing Initiatives**

**Framework Selected: RICE Scoring**
Best for: Balancing multiple initiatives with limited resources, when you need quantifiable comparison.

RICE = (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort

**Scoring Scale**

- Reach: People impacted per quarter (100-10000)
- Impact: 0.25 (minimal) to 3 (massive)
- Confidence: 50-100%
- Effort: Person-weeks

**Priority Matrix (Top 10 of 15)**
| Initiative | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE Score |
|------------|-------|--------|------------|--------|------------|
| Email nurture campaign | 5000 | 2 | 80% | 2 | 4000 |
| Customer referral program | 1000 | 3 | 70% | 3 | 700 |
| SEO content refresh | 3000 | 1 | 90% | 4 | 675 |
| LinkedIn ads pilot | 2000 | 1 | 60% | 2 | 600 |
| Case study series | 500 | 2 | 80% | 3 | 267 |
| Brand video | 2000 | 0.5 | 50% | 8 | 63 |
| Trade show booth | 300 | 2 | 70% | 6 | 70 |

**Recommended Q1 Portfolio (5 Initiatives)**

_Quick Wins (Months 1-2):_

1. Email nurture campaign - Highest RICE, builds pipeline
2. LinkedIn ads pilot - Fast to launch, tests new channel
3. SEO content refresh - Compounds over time

_Strategic (Month 2-3):_ 4. Customer referral program - High impact, requires setup 5. Case study series - Supports sales, brand building

**Visual Priority Map**

```
High Impact | Referral Program | Email Nurture
            | (Build Q1)       | (Start Now)
            |------------------|------------------
Low Impact  | Brand Video      | SEO Refresh
            | (Defer to Q2)    | (Do in Month 1)
            Low Effort ──────── High Effort
```

**Defer/Eliminate**

- _Defer to Q2_: Brand video (high effort, low confidence), Trade show (timing)
- _Eliminate_: Newsletter redesign (low reach), Podcast sponsorship (poor fit)
- _Combine_: Merge webinar series into case study series

**Resource Allocation**

- Person 1: Email + LinkedIn (primary)
- Person 2: SEO + Case studies (primary)
- Person 3: Referral program (lead) + support others

**Review Trigger**: Re-prioritize if any initiative underperforms at month-end checkpoint.
