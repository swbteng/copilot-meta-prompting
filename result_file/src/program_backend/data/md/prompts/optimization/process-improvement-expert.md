## Example Usage

### Input

"Our invoice approval process takes 2-3 weeks, involves 5 departments with lots of manual handoffs and email chains. Finance complains about month-end bottlenecks and can't close books on time. Goal: reduce to under 5 days without adding headcount."

### Output

**Process Improvement Plan: Invoice Approval Optimization**

**1. Current State**

**Process map summary:**

1. Invoice received via email (Accounts Payable) - Day 0
2. Data entry and GL coding (AP) - Days 1-2 (manual entry, coding decisions)
3. Route to department for approval (Manual email) - Day 3 (often wrong department)
4. Department manager approval (varies) - Days 4-10 (main bottleneck)
5. Secondary approval if >$5K (VP level) - Days 11-14
6. Finance verification (Finance) - Days 14-15
7. Payment scheduling (Treasury) - Days 15-17

**Current timeline:** 14-18 days average, up to 25 days for large invoices

**Pain points identified:**

- Manager approval delays: Emails buried in inbox, no urgency, no escalation
- Wrong routing: AP doesn't know correct approver, 15% routing errors
- Month-end pile-up: 40% of invoices submitted last 5 days of month
- Status invisibility: No one knows where an invoice is stuck
- Duplicate entry: Same data entered in multiple systems

**2. Root Cause Analysis**

**Bottleneck 1: Manager approval delays (5-7 day average)**

- Why delayed? Emails buried in inbox, easy to miss
- Why emails? No workflow system, manual process
- Why no urgency? No SLA, no escalation, no visibility to impact
- Why no visibility? No tracking or reporting on approval age
- **Root cause:** No accountability mechanism + email-based workflow

**Bottleneck 2: Manual routing errors (15% re-routing)**

- Why wrong routing? AP guesses based on invoice content
- Why guessing? No documented routing rules by vendor/type
- Why no rules? Organic process growth, never formalized
- **Root cause:** Undocumented tribal knowledge

**Bottleneck 3: Low approval threshold ($5K)**

- Why $5K? Legacy policy from when that was significant
- Why not updated? Never reviewed
- **Root cause:** Policy not updated for current business volume

**Bottleneck 4: Month-end concentration**

- Why end of month? Vendors invoice at month-end + internal deadline pressure
- **Root cause:** External vendor behavior + internal incentives

**3. Improved Process Design**

**Quick Wins (No technology required):**

1. **Raise approval threshold to $15K**
   - Reduces secondary approvals from 40% to 15% of invoices
   - Impact: -3 days average for applicable invoices
   - Risk: Minimal (most >$5K invoices are routine vendor payments)

2. **Implement 2-day approval SLA with escalation**
   - Day 1: Approval request sent
   - Day 2: Reminder if not approved
   - Day 3: Auto-escalate to VP if still pending
   - Impact: Manager approval 5-7 days to 2 days average

3. **Pre-approved vendor list**
   - Routine vendors under $10K: Auto-approve with receipt
   - Impact: 30% of invoices processed same-day

**Process Redesign:**

4. **Documented routing logic**
   - Create decision tree: Vendor category + amount + cost center = approver
   - Train AP on routing rules
   - Impact: Re-routing drops from 15% to <2%

5. **Weekly approval reminder report**
   - Monday AM: Email to all approvers with outstanding items
   - Include: Invoice age, vendor, amount, days pending
   - Impact: Visibility drives accountability

6. **Staggered submission incentives**
   - Early submission discount or priority processing
   - Impact: Spread month-end volume, reduce bottleneck

**Target process timeline:**

- Standard invoice (<$15K): 3-5 days
- Large invoice (>$15K): 5-7 days
- Pre-approved vendor: 1-2 days

**4. Implementation Roadmap**

**Week 1-2: Policy Changes (Quick Wins)**

- Day 1-3: Get approval for threshold increase ($5K to $15K)
- Day 4-7: Communicate new SLA expectations to all approvers
- Day 8-10: Create pre-approved vendor list
- Day 10-14: Document routing logic decision tree
- **Expected: 30% of invoices now processed faster**

**Week 3-4: Process Training**

- Train AP team on new routing logic
- Implement weekly reminder report
- Set up escalation procedure with VP support
- **Expected: Approval delays decrease by 50%**

**Month 2: Refinement**

- Monitor SLA compliance by department
- Address approval backlog from transition
- Adjust threshold and pre-approved list based on results
- Gather feedback from all stakeholders

**Month 3: Evaluate Further Automation**

- Assess results of manual improvements
- Build business case for workflow system if still needed
- Consider OCR for data entry automation

**Change Management:**

- Executive sponsor: CFO (owns the month-end close problem)
- Communication: All approvers informed of new SLA and escalation
- Training: 30-minute session for AP team on new routing
- Incentives: Department-level reporting on approval timeliness
- Support: Finance available for routing questions first 2 weeks

**5. Measurement Framework**

**Primary KPIs:**
| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Average processing time | 17 days | <5 days | Invoice timestamp tracking |
| On-time payment rate | 70% | >95% | ERP payment due tracking |
| First-touch routing accuracy | 85% | >98% | Re-routing incident log |

**Secondary KPIs:**

- Approval SLA compliance by department (target: >90%)
- Month-end invoice volume distribution (target: <30% in last 5 days)
- Invoices per AP staff member (efficiency tracking)
- Vendor complaints about payment delays

**Tracking Approach:**

- Weekly dashboard review for first 3 months
- Monthly reporting thereafter
- Quarterly process review for continuous improvement

**Success Criteria:**

- 80% of invoices processed within 5 days
- Month-end close delay eliminated
- AP overtime reduced by 50%
- Zero late payment penalties
