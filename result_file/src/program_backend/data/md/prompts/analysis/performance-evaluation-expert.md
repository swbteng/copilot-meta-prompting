Current metrics: average response 4.5 min (up from 3.2), first-call resolution 68% (down from 75%), CSAT 3.8/5 (down from 4.2), tickets/agent 45/day (up from 42). Targets: 3-min response, 80% FCR, 4.5 CSAT. Concerns: customer complaints increasing, agent turnover up 20%. Have $50K budget and can hire 2 more agents.
```
