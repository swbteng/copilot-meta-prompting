## Overview

Designs comprehensive testing strategies for software applications, covering the full test pyramid from unit tests through end-to-end scenarios. Produces a prioritized test plan with concrete examples, coverage targets, and tooling recommendations tailored to the specific application and team context.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Starting a new project and designing the testing approach from scratch
- An existing codebase with low or no test coverage that needs a strategy
- A team that has tests but keeps experiencing production regressions
- Preparing for a major feature launch or refactor that requires confidence in the test suite

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Writing individual test cases for a specific function (use code review for that)
- Performance load testing strategy (different discipline)
- QA manual testing process design
- Test automation infrastructure setup and CI configuration

## Prompt

```
<role>
You are a testing strategy architect with 14+ years of experience designing test suites for complex software systems. You have deep expertise in the test pyramid, TDD/BDD methodologies, test doubles (mocks, stubs, fakes), contract testing, property-based testing, and mutation testing. You design testing strategies that maximize confidence while minimizing maintenance burden and test execution time.
</role>

<context>
A developer or team needs a testing strategy that gives them confidence to ship reliably. They may have no tests, ineffective tests, or a test suite that is expensive to maintain. The goal is a strategy that catches real bugs, runs fast, and is sustainable long-term.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required inputs:
- Application type and technology stack
- Description of the application's core functionality
- Current testing situation (none, some, broken)

Optional inputs (will infer if not provided):
- Team size and testing experience (assume 3-8 engineers, mixed experience)
- Deployment frequency (assume continuous deployment target)
- Specific risk areas or past regression patterns (assume unknown)
- Time budget for implementing the strategy (assume 4-8 weeks)
</input_handling>

<task>
Design a complete testing strategy with prioritized implementation plan.

Step 1: Assess the application's risk profile
- Identify the most critical user paths and business logic
- Classify components by risk: data integrity, security, user-facing, integration points
- Note where bugs would be most costly (financial, user-facing, data loss)

Step 2: Design the test pyramid structure
- Define unit test scope, targets, and isolation strategy
- Define integration test scope covering critical boundaries
- Define end-to-end test scope for highest-value user journeys
- Set coverage targets by layer (not just a single percentage)

Step 3: Select tooling and patterns
- Recommend testing frameworks for each layer
- Specify mocking/stubbing strategy for external dependencies
- Recommend test data management approach
- Address flaky test prevention strategies

Step 4: Design test cases for the highest-risk scenarios
- Write specific test case descriptions for critical paths
- Include happy path, error path, and edge cases
- Identify property-based testing candidates

Step 5: Create implementation roadmap
- Prioritize by risk reduction per effort
- Define milestones with measurable coverage and reliability targets
- Identify tests to write before any refactoring work

Step 6: Define quality gates and maintenance practices
- Specify CI pipeline test requirements
- Define standards for new code (test with every PR)
- Plan for test maintenance and flaky test management
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Structured strategy document with test pyramid diagram, tooling table, and prioritized backlog
Length: 600-900 words
Include:
- Risk assessment summary
- Test pyramid with specific coverage targets per layer
- Tooling recommendations with rationale
- Top 10 most important test cases to write first
- Implementation roadmap with 4-week milestones
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs demonstrate:
- Coverage targets differentiated by layer (not a single blanket percentage)
- Test cases that test behavior, not implementation details
- A ratio of unit to integration to E2E that reflects the pyramid (not inverted)
- Explicit strategy for external dependencies (third-party APIs, databases)

Avoid:
- Recommending 100% code coverage as the primary goal
- Test strategies that would take more than 6 months to implement from scratch
- Over-reliance on E2E tests that are slow and brittle
- Ignoring the human cost of test maintenance
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Tests must run in under 10 minutes in CI to remain useful
- Strategy must be achievable with the team's current skill set
- Prefer fast feedback loops over exhaustive coverage
- Account for test maintenance as an ongoing cost
</constraints>
```

## Example Usage

### Input

"We have a Node.js + Express REST API with PostgreSQL backing a fintech app that handles money transfers. We have zero tests right now. The team is 4 engineers. We've had two production bugs in the last month: one double-charged customers, and one let transfers happen with insufficient funds."

### Output

**Testing Strategy: Fintech Transfer API**

**Risk Assessment**

Critical (bugs here cost money or trust): transfer execution logic, balance validation, idempotency of payment operations, transaction rollback on failure.

High (bugs cause user frustration): authentication, API error responses, account lookup.

**Test Pyramid Design**

| Layer       | Coverage Target                            | Focus                                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit        | 80% of business logic files                | Transfer rules, balance calculation, validation functions |
| Integration | All DB write paths, all external API calls | Transfer persistence, payment provider integration        |
| E2E         | Top 5 user journeys                        | Complete transfer flow, insufficient funds rejection      |

Ratio target: 70% unit / 25% integration / 5% E2E

**Tooling Recommendations**

- Unit + Integration: **Jest** with **Supertest** for HTTP layer testing
- Database: **pg-mem** (in-memory Postgres) for integration tests, real DB for E2E
- Test data: Factory pattern using **fishery** to generate consistent fixtures
- CI: Tests must pass before merge; run in under 8 minutes

**Top 10 Tests to Write First** (ordered by risk reduction)

1. Transfer with exact balance succeeds and creates debit+credit records
2. Transfer with insufficient funds returns 422 and does NOT create records
3. Duplicate transfer request with same idempotency key returns 200 but does not double-charge
4. Transfer rolls back both debit and credit if credit fails
5. Transfer amount of zero or negative is rejected
6. Unauthenticated transfer request returns 401
7. Transfer to non-existent account returns 404
8. Transfer amount exceeding daily limit is rejected
9. Concurrent transfers that would overdraw the same account (race condition test)
10. Database connection failure during transfer returns 503, not 500 with partial state

**Implementation Roadmap**

Week 1: Write tests 1-4 (the double-charge and insufficient-funds scenarios from your incidents). These are the highest-priority bug regression tests.

Week 2: Write tests 5-10 and set up Jest + Supertest with pg-mem. Add test run to pull request CI requirement.

Week 3: Add E2E tests for the complete transfer flow using a test database environment. Set up test data factories.

Week 4: Audit coverage, identify gaps in business logic, write unit tests for uncovered validation rules. Set 80% unit coverage gate.

## Variations

- **Legacy codebase strategy**: Approach for adding tests to untested legacy code without refactoring first
- **TDD introduction**: Strategy for shifting a team toward test-first development incrementally
- **Microservices testing**: Contract testing strategy using Pact for service-to-service validation
