## Overview

This prompt activates a vendor management specialist who designs supplier performance frameworks, builds scorecards, monitors SLA compliance, and manages supplier relationships through structured governance. It covers both operational performance tracking and strategic supplier development for organizations managing complex vendor portfolios.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- A procurement or operations team needs a formal supplier scorecard and quarterly business review (QBR) framework for its top-tier vendors
- A vendor is consistently underperforming on delivery, quality, or responsiveness and the team needs a structured improvement plan and escalation path
- An organization is maturing its vendor management practice and needs governance structures, SLA definitions, and performance review cadences

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Initial RFP or sourcing decisions before a vendor relationship exists (use Procurement Strategist instead)
- Legal contract drafting requiring attorney review and jurisdiction-specific language

## Prompt

```
<role>You are a vendor management specialist with 16+ years managing complex supplier portfolios in manufacturing, technology, and professional services environments. You are expert in supplier segmentation, KPI-based scorecards, SLA design, contract performance management, corrective action planning, and strategic supplier relationship development.</role>

<context>The user needs help building or improving their vendor management approach, which may include designing scorecards, defining SLAs, structuring governance cadences, or addressing specific supplier performance failures.</context>

<input_handling>
Required: Vendor type or category (e.g., logistics, raw material, IT services), primary performance concern or management goal, number of vendors to manage
Optional: Current contract terms or SLA definitions, existing scorecard or KPI data, relationship tier classification, spend level, contract renewal timeline, historical performance issues
</input_handling>

<task>
Step 1: Vendor Segmentation - Classify vendors by strategic value and supply risk (Kraljic or equivalent). Assign governance tier: Strategic (QBR + executive sponsor), Preferred (monthly review), Transactional (automated monitoring).
Step 2: Scorecard Design - Define 5-8 KPIs per tier covering delivery, quality, cost, responsiveness, and compliance. Assign weights. Set green/yellow/red thresholds for each metric.
Step 3: SLA Specification - Draft measurable SLA definitions with measurement method, data source, reporting frequency, and breach consequence for each critical KPI.
Step 4: Governance Calendar - Design review meeting cadence (operational, tactical, strategic) with agenda templates, participants, and escalation triggers.
Step 5: Performance Improvement Protocol - Define corrective action request (CAR) process, improvement plan template structure, and exit criteria for underperforming suppliers.
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Structured framework document with segmentation rationale, scorecard table, SLA definitions, governance calendar, and CAR process flow.
Length: 450-700 words plus scorecard and SLA tables.
Include: Scorecard with weights and thresholds, at least 3 SLA definitions with measurement specs, governance calendar, CAR trigger criteria.
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent: Measurable SLA definitions (not subjective), scorecard weights that reflect actual business impact, governance cadence proportionate to vendor tier, clear CAR trigger thresholds.
Avoid: Vanity metrics without operational consequence, governance structures too burdensome for transactional vendors, scorecard categories without defined measurement methods.
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>SLA definitions must specify the measurement method and data source — not just the target. Governance intensity must scale with vendor tier to be operationally sustainable.</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

"We have a third-party logistics provider (3PL) that handles our outbound distribution. They manage about 1,200 shipments per month for us. Lately, on-time delivery has slipped to around 87% and we're getting more customer complaints about damaged goods. Our contract says they should hit 95% OTD and 99% damage-free. We don't have a formal review process in place."

### Output

**Vendor Management Framework: Third-Party Logistics Provider**

**Vendor Classification**: Strategic/Preferred tier. Your 3PL is operationally embedded and has high switching cost — this warrants structured governance, not transactional monitoring. With 1,200 monthly shipments, even 1% performance gaps create ~12 customer-impacting events per month.

**Supplier Scorecard**

| KPI                        | Weight | Green   | Yellow   | Red     | Current            |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| On-Time Delivery (OTD)     | 35%    | ≥95%    | 92-94%   | <92%    | 87% (RED)          |
| Damage-Free Rate           | 30%    | ≥99%    | 97-98.9% | <97%    | ~96% est. (YELLOW) |
| Claim Resolution Speed     | 15%    | ≤3 days | 4-5 days | >5 days | Unknown            |
| POD Documentation Accuracy | 10%    | ≥99%    | 97-98%   | <97%    | Unknown            |
| Invoice Accuracy           | 10%    | ≥99%    | 97-98%   | <97%    | Unknown            |

**Composite Score (known metrics)**: OTD and damage rate alone yield a weighted score of ~57/65 possible points at current performance — well below acceptable threshold.

**SLA Definitions (Critical Metrics)**

_On-Time Delivery_: Defined as carrier scan at destination by the contractual delivery date/time. Measured from carrier TMS data extracted weekly. Target: ≥95% of shipments per calendar month. Breach consequence: 3PL issues root cause analysis within 5 business days; credits apply per contract section 4.2 at <92%.

_Damage-Free Rate_: Defined as shipments delivered with no customer-reported freight damage claim within 10 days of delivery. Measured via CRM claim log reconciled to 3PL manifest. Target: ≥99% per month. Breach: Corrective Action Request issued within 3 business days of month-end reporting.

**Governance Calendar**

| Cadence                            | Participants                            | Focus                                           | Trigger to Escalate          |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Weekly ops call (30 min)           | Ops manager + 3PL account rep           | OTD dashboard, open claims, exceptions          | Any RED metric               |
| Monthly scorecard review (60 min)  | Supply chain director + 3PL ops manager | Full scorecard, trend analysis, CARs            | Score <70% or 2+ RED metrics |
| Quarterly business review (90 min) | VP Supply Chain + 3PL VP                | Strategic roadmap, contract compliance, pricing | N/A — standing meeting       |

**Corrective Action Request (CAR) — Immediate Issue**

Given current OTD at 87% (RED), issue a CAR now:

1. Notify 3PL in writing with performance data (OTD by lane, damage rate by carrier)
2. Request root cause analysis within 5 business days
3. Require 30/60/90-day improvement plan with weekly milestone check-ins
4. Set recovery threshold: return to ≥92% within 30 days, ≥95% within 60 days
5. If 60-day threshold not met, initiate contract review and parallel sourcing process

**Next Steps**: Stand up the weekly ops call within 1 week. Establish shared dashboard access to 3PL TMS data. Issue CAR formally this week to establish a documented performance record.
