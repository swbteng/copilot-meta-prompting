## Overview

This prompt helps researchers design and conduct ethnographic field studies — developing structured observation protocols, contextual inquiry guides, field note practices, and analysis frameworks that capture authentic human behavior in natural contexts. It supports both academic ethnography and applied commercial ethnography for product, service, and organizational design.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Understanding how people actually use a product or service in their natural environment (not a lab)
- Discovering unspoken needs, workarounds, and cultural practices that users cannot or do not articulate in interviews
- Designing for a context you are unfamiliar with and need to observe before designing (healthcare, industrial settings, underserved communities)

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Large-scale quantitative behavioral measurement (use analytics tools)
- Rapid usability testing with a defined prototype (use moderated usability testing)
- Market sizing or statistical generalization (ethnographic findings are not statistically representative)

## Prompt

```
<role>You are a Senior Ethnographic Researcher and Organizational Anthropologist with 15+ years of experience designing and conducting field studies for academic institutions, design consultancies, healthcare organizations, and technology companies. Deep expertise in participant observation design, contextual inquiry, field note methodology, thick description, grounded theory analysis, cultural analysis, reflexivity practice, and translating ethnographic insights into actionable design and strategy recommendations.</role>

<context>The user needs to design or conduct an ethnographic or contextual inquiry study that observes people in their natural environment to understand behaviors, practices, and cultural patterns that cannot be captured through interviews or surveys alone. The research must be ethical, systematic, and produce insights that are both rich and actionable.</context>

<input_handling>
Required: Research question or design challenge, population or context to be observed, access level available (full immersion, scheduled observation, video analysis, contextual inquiry)
Optional: Duration and resource constraints, prior research or assumptions to challenge, specific behaviors or practices of interest, team composition, ethical sensitivities or access restrictions
</input_handling>

<task>
1. Clarify the ethnographic research question and determine appropriate scope: full ethnography, rapid ethnography (3-10 days), or contextual inquiry (1-3 hours per participant)
2. Design the observation protocol: what to observe, how to document it, and what categories of behavior to track
3. Develop a field guide: observation entry points, contextual inquiry questions to integrate into naturalistic observation, and photo/artifact documentation guidance
4. Specify field note practices: structure of field notes, the distinction between observation and interpretation, how to capture verbatim dialogue
5. Address ethical considerations: informed consent in naturalistic settings, confidentiality, power dynamics between researcher and participants, researcher reflexivity
6. Design the analysis framework: how to move from raw field notes to themes to cultural patterns to design implications
7. Develop a thick description format for representing key scenes that captures context, behavior, and meaning — not just surface observation
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Research design document with observation protocol, field guide, ethical framework, analysis method, thick description example
Length: 650-850 words
Include: Scope rationale, observation categories, contextual inquiry guide, field note structure, ethical protocols, analysis framework, sample thick description passage, design implication format
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent: Observation categories capture behaviors not just activities; field notes distinguish observation from interpretation; ethical approach addresses power dynamics and consent in naturalistic settings; analysis moves from description to pattern to meaning; thick description conveys context not just events; design implications are specific
Avoid: Reducing ethnographic observation to a list of what people did; treating first impressions as cultural truths; observation protocols that only capture what the researcher expects to see; ignoring researcher position and its effect on observations; producing rich descriptions that never connect to actionable insight
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>Field notes must distinguish raw observation from researcher interpretation using a two-column or annotation system. Contextual inquiry questions must follow observed behavior — do not interrupt to ask scheduled questions. Ethical consent must be re-confirmed at each observation session for identified participants.</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

"We're designing a new meal kit service aimed at working parents with children under 10. Before we design anything, we want to understand how cooking and meal prep actually happens in these households — the chaos, the shortcuts, the negotiations with picky kids, everything. We have access to conduct 2-hour home visits with 8-10 families. What's the research design?"

### Output

**Ethnographic Research Design — Cooking and Meal Prep in Working Parent Households**
Method: Rapid Contextual Inquiry (Home Visits) | Participants: 8-10 families | Duration: 2 hours per household

---

**Scope and Method Rationale**

Full ethnography (weeks of immersion) is not feasible, but a contextual inquiry approach — observation during an actual cooking session in the participant's home — will capture what surveys and interviews cannot: the physical environment, interruptions, child negotiations, workaround behaviors, and the emotional texture of meal preparation. Two hours during dinner preparation covers the highest-complexity period.

Contextual inquiry is appropriate over pure observation because you can pause and ask about specific behaviors as they occur ("I noticed you just checked your phone — can you tell me what that was?") while remaining in the natural context.

---

**Participant Criteria**

Recruit 8-10 households meeting all of: at least one child aged 3-10; both adults employed at least 20 hours/week (or single parent employed full-time); family cooks at home at least 3 nights per week; not employed in the food industry. Aim for diversity in: household income range, cultural background (eating patterns vary significantly), family size (2-child vs. 4-child dynamics differ), and neighborhood type (urban kitchen size vs. suburban).

**Schedule visits during weekday dinner prep (4:30-7pm)** — this is the highest-friction time. Avoid weekends; weekend cooking behavior is categorically different.

---

**Observation Protocol**

Observe and document across four behavioral dimensions:

**1. Physical Environment and Tools**

- Kitchen layout and storage organization: what is within easy reach vs. buried?
- Technology present: tablets, phones, smart speakers, instant read thermometers, delivery boxes
- What artifacts does the family have that they created to solve cooking problems? (written grocery lists, whiteboard menus, app shortcuts, refrigerator magnets with restaurant numbers)

**2. Temporal and Interruption Patterns**

- When does cooking start? What triggers it — time, hunger signals, a child's request?
- How many times is the primary cook interrupted during a 30-minute cooking window?
- What causes interruptions: children, devices, work notifications, partner, unexpected task?

**3. Decision-Making and Adaptation**

- What decisions are made in real-time that were not pre-planned? (ingredient substitutions, menu changes, task delegation)
- What causes visible stress or frustration? (document exact trigger, not just "stress observed")
- How do children participate, negotiate, or resist?

**4. Shortcut and Workaround Behaviors**

- What pre-made, pre-chopped, or partially prepared items are used?
- What would be "ideal" that clearly isn't happening? (signs of compromise behavior)
- What apps, services, or products are already integrated into the routine?

---

**Field Guide — Contextual Inquiry Questions**

Ask only when a specific behavior has just occurred — do not interrupt flow to follow a question schedule:

- "I noticed you just [specific behavior]. Can you tell me what you were thinking at that moment?"
- "You changed what you were cooking just now — what happened?"
- "How does this compare to a typical night?"
- "If I came back next week, would this look the same?"
- "What would have made that part easier?"
- "What would have happened if [the shortcut they used] wasn't available?"

**Avoid**: "Do you find cooking stressful?" (leading); "Would you use a meal kit service?" (premature solution framing); any question with "usually" or "normally" (invites idealized rather than real behavior).

---

**Field Note Structure**

Use a two-column format during or immediately after each session:

| Raw Observation                                                                                                                | Researcher Interpretation                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Parent opened refrigerator, stared for approximately 15 seconds, closed it, opened a cabinet, then reopened the refrigerator" | Appears to be deciding between options; may not have a plan at this point in the session                     |
| "Child entered kitchen, said 'not pasta again,' and left without waiting for a response"                                       | Child has visibility into meal patterns; vocal rejection is normalized behavior that parent did not react to |

Record verbatim dialogue with quotation marks. Record behavioral timing (note start of cooking, note interruptions with timestamps).

---

**Thick Description — Sample Format**

The following is an example of the level of description to target in field notes, capturing context, behavior, and the researcher's sense of meaning:

_"At 5:47pm, the kitchen is operating at full volume. Maya, 8, is at the kitchen table doing homework — or doing it intermittently, as she has been asking her mother a question approximately every 90 seconds for the past 10 minutes. Her mother, Priya, is simultaneously monitoring rice on the back burner, chopping bell peppers at the island, and responding to each question without visible frustration — this appears to be a practiced rhythm, not an exception. The phone on the counter shows a work Slack notification — Priya glances at it, visibly hesitates, and returns to chopping. The notification is still unread when I leave 45 minutes later. The meal she is preparing (a vegetable stir-fry with rice) takes 25 minutes from start to table. When asked afterward, Priya describes this as 'a simple night.'"_

This level of description reveals: the parallel cognitive demands of cooking + parenting + work; that "simple" is highly relative; and that the phone represents a documented but suppressed source of mental load — none of which would appear in an interview response.

---

**Ethical Protocols**

- Obtain informed consent from adults before each session; remind participants they can stop at any time
- Photograph artifacts (fridges, recipe cards, app screens) only with explicit in-session permission
- Do not photograph or name children in field notes without guardian consent
- Practice researcher reflexivity: note in your analysis how your presence may have altered behavior (observer effect)
- After each session, send participants a brief summary of what you observed and ask if anything should be removed from the record

---

**Analysis Framework**

After all sessions: transcribe field notes → create observation cards (one behavior per card) → affinity diagram by behavioral category → identify patterns that appear across 3+ households → develop cultural insight statements → map insight to design implication.

Distinguish three levels:

1. Observation (what happened)
2. Pattern (what happens repeatedly)
3. Cultural meaning (why it matters, what it reveals about how this group understands their world)

## Variations

- **Remote Ethnography**: Adapted for video diary studies, screen share observations, and asynchronous contextual inquiry when home visits are not feasible
- **Organizational Ethnography**: Adapted for workplace observation — understanding how teams actually work vs. how they describe their work
