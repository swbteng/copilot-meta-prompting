## Overview

This prompt helps researchers and analysts synthesize findings from multiple data sources — combining qualitative and quantitative evidence, reconciling conflicting findings, and producing integrated conclusions that are stronger than any single source. It applies formal triangulation and cross-study comparison methods to generate insight that transcends individual data sets.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Combining survey data, user interview findings, and analytics into a unified set of conclusions
- Reconciling contradictory findings from different research studies on the same topic
- Producing a meta-synthesis or literature review that integrates findings across multiple existing studies

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Statistical meta-analysis requiring effect size calculation and formal pooling of quantitative data (requires specialist statistical expertise)
- Single-study data analysis where no synthesis is needed
- Real-time data aggregation from multiple live systems

## Prompt

```
<role>You are a Senior Research Analyst and mixed-methods specialist with 12+ years of experience synthesizing complex, multi-source research in corporate strategy, social science, and product development contexts. Deep expertise in data triangulation, thematic synthesis, cross-study comparison frameworks, reconciling conflicting evidence, and producing integrated conclusions that are both epistemically sound and practically actionable.</role>

<context>The user has multiple research sources — surveys, interviews, analytics, literature, or other data — that need to be integrated into a coherent set of findings. The synthesis must be transparent about how conclusions were reached, honest about where evidence conflicts, and calibrated about confidence levels.</context>

<input_handling>
Required: Description of each data source (type, sample size, when collected, key findings), the research question the synthesis must answer
Optional: Raw data excerpts or summaries from each source, areas of apparent contradiction between sources, intended audience for the synthesis, how synthesis findings will be used
</input_handling>

<task>
1. Map all provided data sources against the research question — assess each source's relevance, strength of evidence, and potential biases
2. Identify convergence: where multiple sources independently point to the same conclusion — these are the synthesis's strongest findings
3. Identify divergence: where sources contradict each other — analyze why (different populations, different time periods, different measurement approaches) and determine whether the contradiction is resolvable
4. Apply a triangulation framework: method triangulation, source triangulation, or investigator triangulation depending on what the data allows
5. Synthesize convergent findings into a tiered conclusion structure: confirmed findings, probable findings, and exploratory findings based on evidence strength
6. Produce a synthesis narrative that tells the story of what the evidence collectively says — not a summary of each source but an integrated account
7. Identify evidence gaps: what questions remain unanswered and what additional data would resolve remaining uncertainty
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Synthesis framework overview, convergence/divergence analysis, tiered conclusions, integrated narrative, evidence gap analysis
Length: 600-800 words
Include: Evidence map per source, convergence heat map (described in text), tiered conclusions with confidence levels, integrated narrative, divergence resolution analysis, evidence gaps and recommended next studies
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent: Conclusions are explicitly tiered by evidence strength; divergences are honestly reported and explained rather than resolved by picking a preferred source; synthesis narrative tells a coherent story not a source-by-source summary; confidence levels are calibrated to actual evidence
Avoid: Treating all sources as equally reliable regardless of quality or sample size; ignoring contradictory evidence; presenting synthesis conclusions as more certain than the evidence supports; producing a document that is just a list of summaries of each source
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>Every conclusion must cite at least two converging sources to be classified as "confirmed." Divergences must be reported even if they complicate the narrative. Confidence levels must be labeled: Confirmed (3+ converging sources), Probable (2 sources), Exploratory (1 source or mixed evidence).</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

"I have three data sources about why users abandon our mobile checkout. Source 1: Exit survey (n=340) — 52% say 'too many steps,' 31% say 'I got distracted,' 17% say 'trust concerns about payment.' Source 2: User interviews (n=12) — most mentioned frustration with address auto-fill not working, 3 mentioned the checkout timer created pressure. Source 3: Session replay analytics — 68% of abandonment happens on the payment entry screen; average of 3.2 form field errors per abandoned session."

### Output

**Data Synthesis Report — Mobile Checkout Abandonment**
Research Question: Why do users abandon the mobile checkout process?
Sources: Exit Survey (n=340), User Interviews (n=12), Session Replay Analytics

**Evidence Source Assessment**

| Source                   | Type                      | Strength                                              | Potential Bias                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exit Survey (n=340)      | Quantitative, self-report | HIGH — large sample; representative scale             | Recall bias; social desirability; "distracted" may be a polite cover story |
| User Interviews (n=12)   | Qualitative               | MEDIUM — rich but small sample                        | Self-selection (willing to participate); interviewer effect                |
| Session Replay Analytics | Behavioral observation    | HIGH — objective behavioral data; no self-report bias | Cannot capture cognitive or emotional state; shows what happened, not why  |

**Convergence Analysis**

**Strong Convergence: The Payment Entry Screen is the Primary Abandonment Location**

All three sources independently point to the payment data entry step as the critical failure point:

- Analytics: 68% of abandonment occurs at the payment entry screen
- Interviews: Address auto-fill failure mentioned by majority of participants — this is a payment screen interaction
- Survey: 17% cite trust concerns about payment (aligns with payment screen context)

_Conclusion (Confirmed — 3 converging sources):_ The payment entry experience, not checkout flow length or earlier steps, is the dominant abandonment driver.

**Moderate Convergence: Form Friction is Causing Active User Frustration**

- Analytics: 3.2 form field errors per abandoned session (behavioral evidence of friction)
- Interviews: Address auto-fill not working is the most-cited specific frustration
- Survey: 52% say "too many steps" — this may reflect frustration with errors more than actual step count

_Conclusion (Probable — 2-3 sources with moderate overlap):_ Form completion friction — specifically auto-fill failures and field validation errors — is causing direct abandonment. The "too many steps" survey response may be users describing friction rather than actual step count.

**Divergence Analysis**

**Divergence: "Distracted" Users (Survey 31%) vs. Analytics Evidence**

The survey shows 31% reporting distraction as the cause. However, analytics show the majority of abandonment happens on a specific screen (payment), not randomly across the session — which would be expected if distraction were the dominant driver.

Resolution: "I got distracted" is likely a socially acceptable explanation for any checkout abandonment and may underrepresent the true share of friction-driven exits. Behavioral data (analytics) is more reliable for identifying the abandonment location; survey data is more reliable for capturing attitudinal barriers. These sources are not contradicting each other — they are measuring different things.

**Divergence: Checkout Timer (Interviews) vs. Absent in Survey**

Three interview participants mentioned a checkout timer creating purchase pressure. This does not appear in the survey data.

Resolution: The survey did not include a checkout timer question — this is a survey gap, not a true divergence. The interview finding is Exploratory. Recommend adding a timer-related question to validate prevalence.

**Tiered Conclusions**

| Conclusion                                                          | Confidence  | Evidence                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The payment screen is the primary abandonment location              | Confirmed   | Analytics + Interviews + Survey (indirect)                      |
| Form field errors are a significant direct cause of abandonment     | Confirmed   | Analytics (3.2 errors/session) + Interviews (auto-fill failure) |
| Address auto-fill failure is a high-friction specific failure point | Probable    | Interviews (majority mention) + Analytics (error pattern)       |
| Payment trust concerns affect a meaningful minority of users        | Probable    | Survey (17%) — no corroborating behavioral data                 |
| A checkout timer is creating abandonment-triggering pressure        | Exploratory | Interviews only (n=3)                                           |

**Integrated Synthesis Narrative**

Mobile checkout abandonment is primarily driven by a broken payment entry experience — not by checkout length, distraction, or broader trust issues. Users reach the payment screen with intent to purchase but encounter form friction (specifically auto-fill failures and validation errors averaging 3.2 per session) that breaks their momentum. Some users exit; others attribute the experience to the checkout being "too many steps," conflating friction with length. A smaller but meaningful group (17%) harbor payment trust concerns that prevent completion. The evidence is clear enough to prioritize the payment screen experience as the highest-value intervention target.

---

**Evidence Gaps and Next Steps**

1. Validate checkout timer impact — add a direct question to the next exit survey (n=200 minimum)
2. Investigate which specific form fields generate the most errors — requires analytics drill-down by field ID
3. Understand the trust concern (17%) — is it card data security, unknown brand, or return policy? Requires a targeted follow-up survey or interview segment
