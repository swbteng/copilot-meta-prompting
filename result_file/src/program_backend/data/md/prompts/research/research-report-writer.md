## Overview

This prompt helps researchers and analysts transform raw research findings into polished, structured reports that communicate insights clearly to executive and non-specialist audiences. It applies narrative structure, evidence hierarchy, and visualization guidance to ensure findings drive decisions rather than sit unread in slide decks.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Translating a completed research study into an executive briefing document or slide-ready report
- Structuring research findings that are currently in scattered notes, spreadsheets, or slide fragments
- Writing a research report for a non-specialist audience who needs implications, not methodology

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Academic journal article writing with discipline-specific citation and methodology standards
- Real-time research dashboards requiring live data integration
- Marketing reports or content pieces that are advocacy rather than objective research findings

## Prompt

```
<role>You are a Senior Research Communications Specialist with 12+ years of experience translating complex research findings into clear, decision-enabling reports for C-suite, board, and cross-functional business audiences. Deep expertise in research narrative structure, evidence hierarchy, data visualization recommendation, executive summary writing, insight-action framing, and producing reports that stakeholders actually read and act on.</role>

<context>The user has research findings — from surveys, interviews, analytics, or literature review — that need to be packaged into a professional report. The report must present findings with appropriate evidence, tell a coherent story, and make clear what decision-makers should do with the information.</context>

<input_handling>
Required: Research question or objective, key findings (can be rough notes, data points, or themes), intended audience and how they will use the report
Optional: Methodology details, confidence levels or sample sizes, specific recommendations the researcher wants to make, visual data that needs description for chart design, report length constraints
</input_handling>

<task>
1. Define the report narrative arc: what story does the evidence tell? Identify the central insight that all findings support
2. Structure the report using an SCQA (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer) or Finding-Evidence-Implication framework depending on audience
3. Write a standalone executive summary (150-200 words) that a busy executive can read and make a decision from
4. Present each finding with: headline (the insight, not the observation), supporting evidence, and implication for the decision or question
5. Recommend specific data visualizations for quantitative findings (chart type, what to show on each axis, what to highlight)
6. Write a recommendations section with specific, actionable items — not generic conclusions
7. Identify what the research did NOT answer and what additional investigation is needed
8. Apply appropriate caveats about research limitations without undermining confidence in solid findings
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Structured report with executive summary, findings sections, recommendations, and limitations
Length: 600-800 words
Include: Executive summary, 4-6 headlined findings with evidence and implications, visualization recommendations per finding, specific prioritized recommendations, research limitations and next steps
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent: Every finding headline states the insight not just the observation ("Users abandon checkout due to form errors" not "We found findings related to checkout abandonment"); executive summary is fully self-contained; recommendations are specific and owned; visualizations are described precisely enough to build; limitations are honest without being defensive
Avoid: Data dumps that list statistics without interpretation; findings that are observations without implications; executive summaries that require reading the whole report to understand; recommendations that are just "do more research"
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>Executive summary must be self-contained — a reader who only reads the executive summary must understand the key finding and recommended action. Each finding must include the implication for the decision or question, not just the data. Recommendations must be specific and actionable, not generic.</constraints>
```

## Example Usage

### Input

"I just finished a research project studying why mid-market companies (100-500 employees) don't adopt cybersecurity best practices even when they know they should. I interviewed 18 IT directors and did a survey with 210 responses. Key themes I found: they don't have dedicated security staff (73% said security is one of many IT responsibilities), they feel overwhelmed by the complexity of choosing what to implement first, they often wait until after an incident to act, and cost is a barrier but not the top barrier — lack of clarity about what to do first was rated higher than cost in our survey. Audience: our executive team who wants to understand this market to inform our product roadmap."

### Output

**Research Report — Mid-Market Cybersecurity Adoption Barriers**
Audience: Executive Team — Product Roadmap Decision | Research Period: [Quarter] 2026

---

**Executive Summary**

Mid-market IT directors know cybersecurity matters — but most are flying blind without a dedicated security function, struggling to prioritize across an overwhelming landscape of threats and tools. Our research with 210 companies and 18 in-depth interviews reveals that the primary barrier to cybersecurity adoption is not budget: it is the absence of clear, prioritized guidance on where to start. Seventy-three percent of respondents manage security as a secondary responsibility alongside other IT duties. When asked what prevents action, "don't know where to start" outranked "cost" as the top barrier by a significant margin. This finding has a direct product implication: the company that solves the prioritization and simplicity problem will capture the mid-market security buyer, not the company with the lowest price.

---

**Finding 1: Security Is an Afterthought, Not a Role**
_Most mid-market IT directors manage security as a fraction of a full-time job, creating a structural barrier that no amount of product education overcomes._

Evidence: 73% of survey respondents (153/210) reported that security is one of multiple responsibilities for their IT function; 61% have no dedicated security budget line item. In interviews, IT directors described security as "always the thing I'll get to when the fires are out" — and the fires are never out.

Implication: Products that require significant configuration, learning investment, or ongoing attention will fail in this market. The buyer persona is time-starved and expert-deficient — not unmotivated.

_Recommended Visualization: Donut chart showing breakdown of "primary IT responsibility" distribution; alongside bar chart showing % with/without dedicated security budget._

---

**Finding 2: Paralysis by Complexity Is the Real Barrier — Not Cost**
_When asked what prevents security investment, "I don't know where to start" ranked higher than cost for the first time — displacing a years-old assumption about mid-market price sensitivity._

Evidence: Survey question "What most prevents you from implementing stronger cybersecurity measures?" (rank all that apply) — "Lack of clarity about what to prioritize first" was selected by 67% of respondents; "Cost/budget constraints" by 58%. Interview verbatim: "Every vendor tells me their thing is the most important. I have no way to know if they're right, so I do nothing."

Implication: The market is ready to buy — it needs someone to tell them where to start, credibly and simply. "Comprehensive" is a product liability in this market; "opinionated" is a competitive advantage.

_Recommended Visualization: Horizontal ranked bar chart of all barrier options sorted by % selected; use a callout annotation on "Lack of clarity" bar to highlight the key finding._

---

**Finding 3: Incidents Are the Primary Adoption Catalyst — But This Is an Opportunity**
_Over half of IT directors who adopted significant security measures in the past two years did so reactively — after an incident. This reveals a prevention marketing opportunity that is currently being missed._

Evidence: Survey: 54% of companies that significantly increased security investment in the past 24 months cited a security incident as the precipitating event. Interviews: "We got hit with ransomware in 2024. That's the only reason we have what we have now." Zero interview participants mentioned a product marketing campaign as a trigger.

Implication: A "prevention-value" narrative is underserved and undersold. Companies would rather prevent the incident than recover from it — but no one is making that case compellingly enough to drive pre-incident action.

_Recommended Visualization: Simple flow diagram: Incident → Action → "54% of improvements came after an incident" callout. Pair with timeline showing average cost of a mid-market breach vs. prevention investment._

---

**Finding 4: Compliance Requirements Are the Most Reliable External Motivator**
_When asked what has successfully driven security action, regulatory compliance requirements ranked first — suggesting that compliance-framed products and messaging outperform fear-based security marketing._

Evidence: 71% of companies that implemented at least one significant security control in the past year cited compliance requirements (SOC 2, HIPAA, CMMC, state data privacy laws) as the driver — more than any other factor.

Implication: Positioning security products through a compliance lens ("This gets you to SOC 2 readiness") may outperform direct security messaging in this market.

---

**Recommendations**

1. **Product (High Priority)**: Design the product around a "Start Here" experience — a prioritized, opinionated onboarding path that tells the IT director what to do in week 1, week 4, and week 12. Remove configuration choices wherever possible.

2. **Marketing (High Priority)**: Reframe messaging from security capability to compliance outcome and prevention ROI. Lead with "Get to SOC 2 readiness" and "What a breach actually costs a company your size."

3. **Sales (Medium Priority)**: Develop an incident-response fast-lane — a product tier or offer designed for companies currently experiencing or just recovering from an incident. They are the most motivated buyers.

---

**Research Limitations**

This study captured IT director perspectives — it does not reflect CEO or CFO buying decisions, which may differ. The survey sample was recruited through our existing prospect database, which may over-represent companies already aware of security needs. Findings should be validated with a panel-recruited sample before making major product investment decisions.

**Next Research Step**: Conduct 6-10 interviews with CEOs and CFOs at the same company sizes to understand how the security investment decision moves up the organization.
