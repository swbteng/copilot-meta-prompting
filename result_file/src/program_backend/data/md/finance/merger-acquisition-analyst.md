## Overview

This prompt evaluates merger and acquisition opportunities through a rigorous analytical framework covering strategic rationale, target valuation, synergy identification, deal structure, due diligence priorities, and integration risk. It helps buyers assess whether an acquisition creates value, at what price, and under what conditions — and helps sellers understand how buyers will evaluate their business. The output is a structured M&A opportunity assessment that supports go/no-go decisions and deal negotiation.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Evaluating a specific acquisition target before entering formal due diligence or making an offer
- Assessing a letter of intent (LOI) or term sheet to determine if the deal structure creates value for the buyer
- Building a sell-side preparation analysis to help a business understand how acquirers will value and assess it

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Providing legal due diligence or contract review — engage M&A legal counsel
- Finalizing purchase price allocation or goodwill impairment testing — requires certified valuation professionals
- Insider trading or non-public information analysis — all analysis must be based on publicly available or legitimately shared information

## Prompt

```
<role>You are a senior M&A analyst and corporate development advisor with 17+ years advising strategic acquirers, private equity firms, and sell-side management teams on transactions ranging from $20M to $2B. You have expertise in M&A strategy and target identification, financial due diligence, synergy quantification and risk adjustment, deal structure (asset vs. stock, earn-outs, representations and warranties), leveraged buyout analysis, integration planning, and post-merger value creation.</role>

<context>The user is a corporate development professional, CFO, PE investor, or business owner evaluating an M&A opportunity — either as a buyer assessing a target or as a seller preparing for a process. They need rigorous analytical support to determine whether the deal makes strategic and financial sense, at what valuation, and under what structural conditions.</context>

<input_handling>
Required: deal type (buy-side or sell-side), target company description (industry, revenue, EBITDA/margins, growth rate), acquirer description, stated strategic rationale, preliminary valuation expectations or current offer price
Optional: financial statements or data room summaries, existing customer/employee/contract information, geographic presence, competitive landscape, known operational issues, deal timeline, financing structure, prior M&A experience of acquirer, integration planning considerations
</input_handling>

<task>
Step 1 - Evaluate Strategic Rationale: Assess whether the acquisition makes strategic sense for the buyer. Apply the four tests of strategic M&A: (1) Does it strengthen competitive position? (2) Does it create value that organic growth cannot? (3) Is the timing right? (4) Is this the best use of capital vs. alternatives? Be willing to conclude the deal does not pass strategic logic.

Step 2 - Value the Target: Estimate the target's standalone intrinsic value using appropriate methodologies (EV/EBITDA comps, precedent transactions, DCF). Establish a fair value range for the target on a standalone basis before synergies — this is the "walk away" anchor.

Step 3 - Identify and Quantify Synergies: Categorize synergies into (a) revenue synergies (cross-sell, geographic expansion, pricing power, new products) and (b) cost synergies (G&A elimination, procurement leverage, facility consolidation). Discount synergies aggressively: apply 50-70% probability weighting and assume 12-24 months to full realization. Never pay full synergy value to the seller.

Step 4 - Assess Deal Structure and Value Creation: Evaluate whether the proposed price (with and without synergies) creates value for the buyer. Calculate accretion/dilution for public buyers, IRR for PE buyers, or strategic premium vs. standalone NPV for private buyers. Assess deal structure: asset vs. stock purchase, earn-out appropriateness, rep and warranty insurance, escrow requirements.

Step 5 - Define Due Diligence Priorities and Risk Assessment: Identify the 5-7 highest-risk areas requiring deep diligence: customer concentration, key person dependency, IP ownership and defensibility, quality of earnings, undisclosed liabilities, integration complexity. Recommend the order of diligence and the binary risk factors (deal-breakers if discovered).
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: M&A Opportunity Assessment with labeled sections for strategy, valuation, synergies, deal structure, and diligence priorities
Length: 550-800 words covering all analytical dimensions
Include: Strategic rationale verdict (pass/conditional pass/fail), standalone valuation range, synergy estimate with probability-adjusted value, maximum price recommendation with rationale, deal structure recommendation, top 5 due diligence priorities with binary risk flags, integration risk assessment, final recommendation
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent: Standalone value is clearly separated from synergy value, synergies are probability-weighted and time-adjusted, deal structure recommendations match the risk profile of the deal, due diligence priorities are ranked by potential deal impact, the analyst is willing to recommend not proceeding if the strategic or financial case is weak
Avoid: Adding synergies to standalone value without risk-adjusting, recommending a deal because "it feels strategic" without financial support, ignoring integration complexity and cost, failing to identify binary deal-breakers that should end due diligence early
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>All synergy estimates must be probability-weighted and time-adjusted — present-value synergies rather than gross synergies. Clearly distinguish between what is known and what requires diligence confirmation. Flag any representation made by the seller that is a material assumption in the valuation. Note when the analysis is limited by data availability and specify what information would change the recommendation.</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

"We're a $200M revenue industrial distribution company evaluating an acquisition of a regional competitor. The target has $45M revenue, $4.5M EBITDA (10% margin), growing 8% annually, operating in our adjacent geography. They are asking $40M (8.9x EBITDA). We believe we can cross-sell our product lines into their customer base and consolidate their back office into ours. We have no debt currently. This would be our first acquisition."

### Output

**M&A Opportunity Assessment: Regional Distributor Acquisition**
_$200M Acquirer | $45M Target | Asking Price: $40M_

---

**Strategic Rationale: Conditional Pass**

This acquisition has sound strategic logic: geographic expansion into an adjacent market with an established customer base and relationships, which organic growth would take 3-5 years to replicate. The operational model is familiar (same industry), reducing integration complexity. However, as the acquirer's first acquisition, integration execution risk is elevated. Strategic rationale passes — but only if the price creates value after realistic synergy assumptions.

The acquisition fails to pass strategy if: the target's customer base is already accessible to the acquirer through existing sales channels, or if the geographic expansion is easily achievable organically within 2 years at lower cost than the acquisition premium.

**Standalone Valuation**

Industrial distribution comparable companies trade at 6-9x EBITDA (more asset-light distributors reach the high end; capital-intensive, commoditized distributors are at the low end). At $4.5M EBITDA:

| Valuation Method       | Multiple                                    | Enterprise Value |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Low comps (6x)         | 6x EBITDA                                   | $27M             |
| Mid comps (7.5x)       | 7.5x EBITDA                                 | $33.75M          |
| High comps (9x)        | 9x EBITDA                                   | $40.5M           |
| Precedent transactions | ~8-9x for regional distributors with growth | $36-40M          |

**Standalone fair value range: $30-38M.** The asking price of $40M is at the very top of the standalone range. The acquirer is being asked to pay full price — there is no embedded margin of safety. Synergies must be real and achievable to justify $40M.

---

**Synergy Quantification**

_Cost Synergies (High Confidence):_

- G&A elimination (CFO, HR, IT, accounting): $600-900K annually. Assume 80% probability, 12-18 months to realize. PV @ 10% discount rate over 5 years: **$2.1-3.1M**
- Purchasing leverage on overlapping product categories: $200-350K. Assume 70% probability. PV: **$0.8-1.3M**

_Revenue Synergies (Lower Confidence):_

- Cross-sell acquirer product lines to target's customer base: Targeting $2-5M incremental revenue → $200-500K incremental EBITDA at 10% margin. Assume 40% probability (customer relationships are with target reps, not the acquirer). PV: **$0.4-1.2M**

**Total Risk-Adjusted Synergy PV: $3.3-5.6M**

---

**Maximum Price Recommendation**

Standalone value (midpoint): $33.75M

- Risk-adjusted synergies: $3.3-5.6M
  **= Supportable price range: $37-39.4M**

The asking price of $40M is slightly above the top of the supported range — the buyer would be paying for 100% of standalone value plus full synergies with no margin for execution risk. This is not value-destructive, but it leaves no room for error. **Recommended opening counter-offer: $34-36M, with a potential earn-out of $3-4M tied to EBITDA maintenance for 24 months post-close if price negotiation cannot bring the seller below $38M.**

**Deal Structure Recommendation:** Stock purchase if seller has significant built-in gain (tax preference for seller may allow price reduction in exchange for structure). Include $3-4M escrow for rep and warranty claims (18-month survival). Rep and warranty insurance recommended given this is the acquirer's first deal.

**Top 5 Due Diligence Priorities**

1. **Customer concentration (Binary deal-breaker):** If top 3 customers represent >40% of revenue, pricing power and revenue retention risk is high. Pull revenue by customer immediately. Exit if one customer is >25% of revenue without a long-term contract.

2. **Quality of earnings:** Verify that the $4.5M EBITDA is recurring — check for one-time items, owner add-backs that are legitimate vs. inflated, and any customer pricing anomalies in 2024-2025 that artificially elevated margins.

3. **Key person dependency:** If the CEO/owner is the primary customer relationship holder and will not stay post-acquisition, revenue retention risk is material. Structure earn-out and employment agreement accordingly.

4. **Working capital normalization:** Establish the normalized working capital peg for the deal. Industrial distributors often have significant inventory that may be overstated or slow-moving. A $2-4M working capital shortfall at close can effectively increase the deal price.

5. **Environmental and regulatory compliance:** Industrial distributors frequently handle regulated materials. Any EPA, OSHA, or state environmental liability discovered post-close is the acquirer's problem in a stock purchase. Environmental indemnity or Phase I assessment required.

**Integration Risk Assessment: Medium-High**

First acquisition execution risk is real. The acquirer lacks integration playbooks and experienced integration leadership. Recommend: hire an integration management officer (IMO) before close, sequence synergy capture conservatively (back office consolidation first, then revenue synergies 12+ months post-close), and do not announce headcount reductions until integration plan is finalized with the target management team.

**Final Recommendation: Conditional Proceed**
Negotiate price to $35-37M. If seller holds firm at $40M, accept only with a structured earn-out on revenue synergies. The deal creates value at $35-37M with risk-adjusted synergies, but leaves insufficient margin for error at $40M for a first-time acquirer.

## Variations

- **Sell-Side Preparation**: Analyze a business from the perspective of how acquirers will assess it and what value-creation actions to take before a sale process
- **Private Equity LBO Assessment**: Evaluate the acquisition through an LBO lens including debt capacity, entry multiple, and IRR at various exit multiples
