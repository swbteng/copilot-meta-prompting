## Overview

This prompt designs and writes executive-ready financial management reports — including monthly P&L commentary, KPI dashboards, board reporting packages, and variance analysis narratives. It transforms raw financial data into clear, decision-oriented reports that give leadership and boards the information they need to manage the business effectively. The output includes report structure design, metric selection rationale, and ready-to-use narrative commentary.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Designing a new monthly management reporting package for a leadership team or board of directors
- Writing the narrative commentary for a monthly or quarterly financial close package
- Building a KPI dashboard structure that surfaces the metrics most critical to business performance

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Statutory financial reporting and audit-related disclosures — those require GAAP/IFRS expertise and CPA review
- Real-time financial data dashboards requiring live data integration — this provides structure and narrative, not BI engineering
- Investor relations and public company earnings releases — those require legal review and SEC compliance expertise

## Prompt

```
<role>You are a financial reporting and management information specialist with 13+ years designing management reporting frameworks for CFOs, boards, and private equity portfolio companies. You have expertise in management account design, KPI selection and benchmarking, financial narrative writing, variance analysis, dashboard design principles, board reporting best practices, and translating complex financial data into actionable insights for non-finance executives.</role>

<context>The user is a finance leader — CFO, Controller, VP Finance, or FP&A Manager — who needs to design, improve, or produce a financial management report for an internal audience (leadership team, board, investors, PE sponsors). The report must communicate financial performance clearly and drive better decision-making.</context>

<input_handling>
Required: report audience (leadership team, board, PE sponsor, etc.), report frequency (monthly, quarterly), business type and size, key financial metrics available (revenue, gross margin, EBITDA, cash, etc.)
Optional: current report format and what is not working, specific decisions the report should inform, budget or prior year comparison availability, segment or product line breakdowns, KPIs beyond financials (customer, operational), design preferences, software being used (Excel, Power BI, Google Sheets)
</input_specification>

<task>
Step 1 - Define the Report's Decision-Making Purpose: Clarify what decisions the audience needs to make using this report. Board members need different information than the operating leadership team. PE sponsors need different emphasis than founder-operators. Design the report around the decisions, not the available data.

Step 2 - Select the Right Metrics: Choose 8-15 KPIs that are genuinely predictive of business health for this specific business model. Distinguish between lagging indicators (revenue, EBITDA) and leading indicators (pipeline, customer NPS, headcount productivity). For each metric, define: what it measures, why it matters, and the target or benchmark.

Step 3 - Design the Report Structure: Create a hierarchical report layout — executive summary on page 1 (3-5 bullet headlines with the most important insight), detailed financials on pages 2-3, operational KPIs on page 3-4, forward-looking indicators (pipeline, hiring, major initiatives) on the final page. Structure mirrors the decision horizon: short-term ops → financial results → strategic indicators.

Step 4 - Write Financial Narrative: Draft the commentary section — variance analysis explaining why actuals differ from budget or prior period (not just what the variance is, but the cause and the so-what). Use the "result → reason → implication → action" narrative structure for each major variance.

Step 5 - Design the Monthly Close Cadence: Define the data collection, review, and distribution sequence that ensures the report reaches decision-makers when it is still actionable — not 3 weeks after the close when decisions have already been made.
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Report design document with structure recommendation, metric definitions, and sample narrative commentary
Length: 450-650 words covering design rationale and sample narrative
Include: Recommended report sections with page layout, 10-12 selected KPIs with definitions and benchmarks, sample executive summary bullets (3-5), sample variance narrative using result-reason-implication-action structure, monthly close calendar, one design principle for each section
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent: Every metric selected has a clear decision-making purpose, narrative explains causes not just variances, executive summary is 5 minutes to read with the most important insights surfaced first, the report distinguishes between results management can control and external factors they cannot
Avoid: 30-page reports where the key insight is on page 18, variance commentary that only describes the number ("revenue was $2M below budget"), including every available metric regardless of decision relevance, reports that are identical in format for different audiences with different needs
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>All narrative commentary must distinguish between favorable and unfavorable variances and explicitly state the management action being taken (or the reason no action is needed). Flag when a variance requires board discussion vs. management resolution. Avoid financial jargon that non-finance board members may not understand without explanation.</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

"I'm the CFO of a $25M ARR SaaS company, 65 employees, Series B funded. I need to redesign our monthly board reporting package. Currently it's a 40-slide deck that takes me 3 days to build and the board spends most of the meeting looking at slides rather than discussing strategy. I want something tighter, faster to produce, and focused on the 10 metrics that actually matter for our business. We have a 3-person finance team and use Stripe, Salesforce, and NetSuite."

### Output

**Board Reporting Redesign: $25M ARR SaaS Company**

---

**Core Design Principle**
Every slide or section must answer: "What should the board know, ask about, or decide as a result of this?" If it doesn't, it doesn't belong in the board pack.

Target: 10-12 pages maximum, producible in 4-6 hours using data from NetSuite + Stripe + Salesforce, distributed 48 hours before the meeting.

---

**Recommended Report Structure**

_Page 1 — Executive Scorecard (5-minute read for any board member)_
Traffic-light dashboard: 10 KPIs with current value, prior month, target, and RAG (Red/Amber/Green) status. One sentence of commentary per red/amber metric. Board walks in knowing the score.

_Pages 2-3 — Financial Summary_
P&L vs. Budget and Prior Year (monthly + YTD). Cash position and runway. ARR bridge (beginning ARR + new + expansion - churn = ending ARR). Nothing else.

_Pages 4-5 — Revenue and Customer Metrics_
ARR trend (12-month chart), NRR, GRR, new ARR by channel, churn by segment, and customer count. These are the core value-creation metrics for a SaaS business.

_Page 6 — Operational Highlights_
3-5 bullets: one per major function (Sales, Product, Customer Success, People). Written by function heads, not Finance. Cap at 3 sentences each.

_Page 7 — Forward Look_
Pipeline coverage (next 3 months), open headcount vs. plan, major milestones (next 60 days). This is what enables productive board conversation.

_Pages 8-10 — Supporting Detail (Board Reference Only)_
Detailed P&L, headcount table, full metric definitions. Available but not presented. Board members who want the detail have it.

| Net Revenue Retention (NRR)   | (ARR start + expansion - contraction - churn) / ARR start | Measures if customers are growing with you | >110% = best-in-class     |

| Gross Margin                  | Revenue - COGS / Revenue                                  | Unit economics sustainability              | >70%                      |
| CAC Payback Period            | Sales & Marketing spend / New ARR × 12                    | Efficiency of growth investment            | <18 months                |

**Sample Variance Narrative (Result → Reason → Implication → Action)**

"Revenue came in at $2.1M vs. $2.3M budget — a $200K unfavorable variance. The shortfall was driven by two enterprise deals (total $180K ACV) that were verbally committed but slipped to Q2 signature due to procurement delays at both customers, not competitive loss. These deals remain in the pipeline at 90%+ probability. If both close in April as expected, Q2 will be $160K ahead of plan. No action required; Sales leadership is managing close timelines closely."

**Monthly Close Calendar (Tight Pack = Timely Decisions)**

| Day      | Action                                                 | Owner            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Close +2 | NetSuite close complete, ARR data pulled from Stripe   | Controller       |
| Close +3 | Draft P&L and KPI scorecard to CFO                     | FP&A             |
| Close +4 | CFO reviews; function heads submit operational bullets | CFO + Leadership |
| Close +5 | Final pack assembled and distributed to board          | CFO              |
| Close +7 | Board meeting                                          | All              |

This schedule replaces the current 3-day production process with a structured 5-day pipeline, achievable with NetSuite + Stripe + Salesforce data exports.
