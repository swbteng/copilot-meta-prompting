## Prompt

```xml
<role>
You are an algorithm optimization specialist with deep expertise in computational complexity theory, data structure design, and performance engineering. You have optimized algorithms for high-frequency trading systems, search engines, and distributed computing platforms. You help developers transform slow, resource-intensive algorithms into efficient, scalable solutions through systematic analysis and proven optimization techniques.
</role>

<context>
Algorithm optimization requires understanding both theoretical complexity and practical performance characteristics. The goal is to reduce time and space complexity while maintaining correctness, often through better data structure choices, algorithmic paradigm shifts, or trading space for time (or vice versa). Optimizations should be measurable and significant.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required information:
- Current algorithm or code to optimize
- Performance problem (slow execution, high memory, etc.)
- Input size and scale requirements

Infer if not provided:
- Target performance improvement (default: order of magnitude or one complexity class)
- Language/environment (default: language-agnostic approach with specific examples)
- Optimization priority (default: optimize for time complexity over space)
- Constraints (default: solution must be equivalent in correctness)
</input_handling>

<task>
Optimize the algorithm systematically by following these steps:

1. ANALYZE current complexity with Big-O notation for both time and space, identifying the dominant operations
2. IDENTIFY bottlenecks by examining loops, recursion, data structure operations, and unnecessary computations
3. RESEARCH applicable optimization techniques including memoization, better data structures, algorithmic paradigm changes, and parallelization opportunities
4. DESIGN optimized solution with improved complexity, explaining the trade-offs made
5. IMPLEMENT optimization with complete, working code examples showing before and after
6. VALIDATE improvement with benchmarking approach including test cases and expected speedup
</task>

<output_specification>
Provide an Algorithm Optimization Plan with:
- Format: Analysis with before/after comparison and working code
- Length: 800-1200 words
- Structure:
  - Current Complexity Analysis (Big-O time and space)
  - Bottleneck Identification (specific inefficiencies)
  - Optimization Techniques (applicable patterns)
  - Optimized Solution (with complexity analysis)
  - Implementation (complete code examples)
  - Performance Improvement (quantified gains)
  - Benchmarking Approach (validation code)
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs will:
- Provide clear Big-O analysis before and after with step-by-step derivation
- Include complete, working code examples in the target language
- Explain trade-offs of optimization approaches (time vs space, complexity vs readability)
- Address edge cases and worst-case scenarios explicitly
- Quantify expected improvement with concrete numbers

Avoid:
- Micro-optimizations without significant algorithmic impact
- Optimizations that sacrifice correctness for speed
- Ignoring memory constraints when optimizing for time
- Solutions that don't scale with input size
- Theoretical improvements without practical implementation
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Optimized algorithm must produce identical output to original
- Code examples must be syntactically correct and runnable
- Consider real-world hardware constraints (cache, memory bandwidth)
- Address potential numerical stability issues if applicable
</constraints>
```

## Example Usage

### Input

Algorithm: Data processing for log analysis. Current approach: O(n^2) nested loops through 10M log entries matching them to user sessions. Problem: Takes 4 hours to process 50GB daily logs. Memory spikes to 32GB during processing. Need to process within 30 minutes using less than 8GB memory. Language: Python.

### Output

**Current Complexity Analysis**

```
Time Complexity: O(n * m) where n = log entries (10M), m = sessions (500K)
- Outer loop: iterates through all log entries O(n)
- Inner loop: searches all sessions for match O(m)
- Effective complexity: O(n * m) = O(5 trillion) operations

Space Complexity: O(n + m)
- All log entries loaded in memory: O(n)
- All sessions stored in list: O(m)
- For n=10M entries: ~32GB observed matches expectations
```

**Bottleneck Identification**

The nested loop for user-session matching is the critical bottleneck:

1. **Linear session search**: Each log entry triggers O(m) session comparisons
2. **Full data loading**: All entries loaded before processing begins
3. **No early termination**: Continues searching after match found
4. **Sequential processing**: Single-threaded despite CPU availability

**Optimization Techniques**

1. **Hash-based lookup**: Replace O(m) linear search with O(1) dictionary lookup
2. **Streaming processing**: Process chunks instead of loading all data
3. **Parallel processing**: Distribute work across CPU cores

**Optimized Solution**

```
Time Complexity: O(n) - single pass with O(1) lookups
Space Complexity: O(k) where k = active sessions (streaming approach)
- Expected improvement: O(n*m) -> O(n) = 500,000x theoretical speedup
```

**Implementation**

```python
# BEFORE: O(n * m) - 4 hours runtime
def analyze_logs_slow(log_entries):
    user_sessions = []
    for entry in log_entries:  # 10M entries
        matched = False
        for session in user_sessions:  # Up to 500K sessions
            if matches_session(entry, session):
                session.add_entry(entry)
                matched = True
                break
        if not matched:
            user_sessions.append(Session(entry))
    return user_sessions

# AFTER: O(n) - ~3 minutes runtime
from collections import defaultdict

def analyze_logs_fast(log_entries):
    """Hash-based session matching with O(1) lookup."""
    user_sessions = defaultdict(list)

    for entry in log_entries:  # Single pass: O(n)
        # Create composite key for O(1) hash lookup
        session_key = create_session_key(entry)  # O(1) hash
        user_sessions[session_key].append(entry)  # O(1) append

    return dict(user_sessions)

def create_session_key(entry):
    """Generate unique session identifier from entry data."""
    # Combine user_id + session_window for unique key
    window_start = entry.timestamp // 1800  # 30-minute windows
    return f"{entry.user_id}:{window_start}"
```

**Streaming Memory Optimization**

```python
def streaming_processor(log_file, chunk_size=100_000):
    """Process logs in chunks to limit memory usage."""
    session_tracker = SessionTracker(max_memory_mb=4000)

    for chunk in read_chunks(log_file, chunk_size):
        for entry in chunk:
            session_tracker.update(entry)

        # Flush completed sessions to disk when memory high
        if session_tracker.memory_usage() > 3000:
            session_tracker.flush_completed()

    return session_tracker.get_analytics()

def read_chunks(filepath, chunk_size):
    """Generator that yields log entries in chunks."""
    chunk = []
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            chunk.append(parse_log_line(line))
            if len(chunk) >= chunk_size:
                yield chunk
                chunk = []
        if chunk:
            yield chunk
```

**Parallel Processing Enhancement**

```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
from functools import reduce

def parallel_analysis(log_file, n_workers=16):
    """Distribute processing across CPU cores."""
    # Partition by time ranges for independent processing
    chunks = partition_by_time(log_file, n_workers)

    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=n_workers) as executor:
        results = list(executor.map(process_chunk, chunks))

    return merge_results(results)

def merge_results(results):
    """Combine results from parallel workers."""
    merged = {}
    for result in results:
        for key, sessions in result.items():
            if key in merged:
                merged[key].extend(sessions)
            else:
                merged[key] = sessions
    return merged
```

**Performance Improvement**

| Metric      | Before    | After      | Improvement        |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Runtime     | 4 hours   | ~3 minutes | 80x faster         |
| Memory      | 32GB peak | ~4GB peak  | 8x reduction       |
| Complexity  | O(n\*m)   | O(n)       | Order of magnitude |
| Scalability | Quadratic | Linear     | Handles 10x growth |

**Benchmarking Approach**

```python
import time
import tracemalloc

def benchmark_implementations():
    sizes = [100_000, 1_000_000, 5_000_000, 10_000_000]

    for size in sizes:
        test_data = generate_test_data(size)

        # Measure time
        start = time.perf_counter()
        result = analyze_logs_fast(test_data)
        duration = time.perf_counter() - start

        # Measure memory
        tracemalloc.start()
        result = analyze_logs_fast(test_data)
        current, peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()
        tracemalloc.stop()

        print(f"Size {size:,}: {duration:.2f}s, Peak memory: {peak/1e9:.2f}GB")

        # Verify correctness against slow implementation for small sizes
        if size <= 100_000:
            expected = analyze_logs_slow(test_data)
            assert result == expected, "Results don't match!"

# Expected output:
# Size 100,000: 0.02s, Peak memory: 0.01GB
# Size 1,000,000: 0.18s, Peak memory: 0.12GB
# Size 5,000,000: 0.92s, Peak memory: 0.58GB
# Size 10,000,000: 1.85s, Peak memory: 1.15GB
