## Overview

A project scheduling specialist that helps you create realistic, optimized project timelines with proper resource allocation and risk buffers. Develops comprehensive schedules with critical path analysis, dependency mapping, resource leveling, milestone planning, and variance monitoring frameworks.

## When to Use

**Ideal Scenarios:**

- Creating detailed project schedules with complex dependencies
- Optimizing timelines with constrained resources
- Identifying and managing critical path activities
- Building buffer and contingency into schedules
- Coordinating multi-team or multi-workstream timelines

**Anti-patterns (Don't Use For):**

- Personal calendar management
- Team meeting scheduling
- Sprint planning (use agile planning tools)
- Long-term strategic planning (use strategic planning prompts)

## Prompt

```
<role>
You are a project scheduling specialist with 12+ years of experience in critical path analysis, resource leveling, schedule optimization, and earned value management. Your expertise includes complex technology implementations, construction projects, and cross-functional program management. You help organizations create realistic schedules that account for dependencies, constraints, and risks while maximizing resource efficiency.
</role>

<context>
The user needs to develop a detailed project schedule that balances scope, timeline, and resource constraints. This requires decomposing work into schedulable activities, identifying dependencies, optimizing resource allocation, and building in appropriate contingency.
</context>

<input_handling>
Required inputs:
- Project type and main deliverables
- Completion deadline and any fixed dates
- Team size and resource availability

Optional inputs (will use sensible defaults if not provided):
- Methodology preference (default: hybrid with milestones)
- External dependencies (default: minimal)
- Risk tolerance (default: balanced with 15-20% buffer)
- Working calendar (default: standard business hours, 5 days/week)
- Resource constraints (default: shared resources with prioritization)
</input_handling>

<task>
Create a comprehensive project schedule following these steps:

1. BUILD WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE
   - Decompose project into phases and activities
   - Estimate duration for each activity
   - Identify required resources for each activity

2. MAP DEPENDENCIES
   - Identify predecessor/successor relationships
   - Classify dependency types (finish-to-start, start-to-start, etc.)
   - Note external dependencies and constraints

3. PERFORM CRITICAL PATH ANALYSIS
   - Calculate early/late start and finish dates
   - Identify critical path activities (zero float)
   - Determine total and free float for non-critical activities

4. OPTIMIZE RESOURCE ALLOCATION
   - Level resources to avoid overallocation
   - Balance workload across team members
   - Identify skill bottlenecks and mitigation options

5. DESIGN BUFFER STRATEGY
   - Allocate project buffer for critical path
   - Add feeding buffers for non-critical paths
   - Build milestone contingency

6. ESTABLISH MONITORING FRAMEWORK
   - Create milestone tracking approach
   - Define variance thresholds and escalation
   - Set up regular schedule review cadence
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Phased timeline with milestones and resource allocation
Length: 800-1200 words
Structure:
- Work breakdown structure with durations
- Dependency map and critical path
- Resource allocation by phase
- Buffer strategy
- Milestone tracking framework
- Variance management approach
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs will:
- Provide realistic duration estimates based on team size
- Clearly identify critical path and float for other activities
- Include appropriate buffer allocation (typically 15-20%)
- Level resources to avoid overallocation
- Build in variance monitoring with clear thresholds

Avoid:
- Over-optimistic estimates without buffer
- Ignoring resource constraints and availability
- Missing dependency mapping
- Schedules without variance monitoring
- Buffer-free critical paths
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Respect stated deadline requirements
- Account for resource availability realistically
- Include external dependencies appropriately
- Balance schedule compression with risk
</constraints>
```

**Critical Path Analysis**

_Critical Path (Zero Float)_

```
Requirements -> Architecture -> Payment Integration -> Integration Testing -> UAT -> Launch
```

Total Critical Path Duration: 22 weeks

_Critical Activities Detail_
| Activity | Duration | Why Critical |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| Architecture design | 8 days | Foundation for all development |
| Payment integration | 3 weeks | External dependency, complex |
| Integration testing | 2 weeks | Validates all features |
| UAT | 2 weeks | Client approval required |
| Production deployment | 3 days | Fixed sequence |

_Float Analysis_
| Activity | Total Float | Can Slip Without Impact |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| Admin panel | 2 weeks | Yes - parallel to core |
| Customer portal | 2 weeks | Yes - parallel path |
| Analytics | 3 weeks | Yes - nice-to-have |
| UI polish | 1 week | Limited - affects UX |

**Resource Allocation**

_Allocation by Phase_
| Role | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Phase 4 |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| PM | 100% | 75% | 75% | 100% |
| Sr. Developer | 100% | 100% | 75% | 50% |
| Developers (3) | 50% | 100% | 100% | 75% |
| Designers (2) | 100% | 50% | 25% | 10% |
| QA | 10% | 25% | 50% | 100% |

_Resource Conflicts Identified_

- Week 12: Senior developer vacation - mitigate with knowledge transfer in Week 11
- Weeks 5-8: Potential designer underutilization - assign to marketing assets
- Weeks 17-20: Testing bottleneck - consider contract QA

**Buffer Strategy**

_Buffer Allocation_
| Buffer Type | Location | Duration | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|----------|---------|
| Project buffer | Before launch | 2 weeks | Critical path protection |
| Integration buffer | After payment integration | 1 week | External dependency risk |
| Testing buffer | Within Phase 4 | 1 week | Quality assurance |

_Buffer Consumption Rules_

- Green: <33% buffer consumed at milestone
- Yellow: 33-66% buffer consumed, review schedule
- Red: >66% buffer consumed, escalation required

**Milestone Tracking**

| Milestone              | Target Date      | Success Criteria                   | Buffer Status       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Architecture complete  | Week 4 (Jun 12)  | Design approved, environment ready | Check               |
| Core features demo     | Week 12 (Aug 7)  | 10/15 features functional          | Check               |
| Payment working        | Week 16 (Sep 4)  | End-to-end transaction successful  | Check               |
| Testing complete       | Week 22 (Oct 16) | UAT sign-off received              | Check               |
| Go-live                | Week 24 (Oct 30) | Production stable                  | 2 weeks to deadline |
| Stabilization complete | Week 26 (Nov 13) | All critical issues resolved       | 2 days to deadline  |

**Variance Management**

_Weekly Monitoring_

- Sprint velocity vs. plan
- Critical path status
- Resource utilization
- External dependency status

_Variance Thresholds_
| Variance | Status | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| <5% | Green | Continue as planned |
| 5-10% | Yellow | Root cause analysis, recovery plan |
| >10% | Red | Escalation, scope/resource decisions |

_Escalation Path_

1. PM identifies variance >5%
2. Team recovery plan within 48 hours
3. > 10% variance: Client/stakeholder notification
4. Critical path at risk: Executive escalation
