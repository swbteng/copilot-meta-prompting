- Infrastructure maturity (default: cloud-native with CI/CD)
- Team structure (default: single product team)
- SLA requirements (default: 99.9% availability)
- Compliance requirements (default: standard security practices)
</input_handling>

<task>
Create a comprehensive release plan following these steps:

1. DEFINE RELEASE STRATEGY
   - Select appropriate deployment approach (blue-green, canary, rolling)
   - Design traffic management and rollout phases
   - Establish feature flag strategy for controlled activation

2. BUILD RELEASE TIMELINE
   - Create pre-release checklist with validation gates
   - Schedule deployment phases with duration
   - Plan post-release monitoring period

3. DESIGN RISK MANAGEMENT
   - Identify release-specific risks
   - Define rollback triggers and procedures
   - Establish incident response protocols

4. CREATE ROLLOUT PLAN
   - Design progressive traffic routing
   - Set validation criteria between phases
   - Plan communication for each phase

5. ESTABLISH MONITORING FRAMEWORK
   - Define key metrics and alerting thresholds
   - Create health check criteria
   - Set up dashboards for release visibility

6. DEVELOP STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION
   - Plan internal team coordination
   - Prepare customer communication (if needed)
   - Establish status update cadence
</task>

<output_specification>
Format: Phased deployment plan with procedures
Length: 1000-1500 words
Structure:
- Release strategy and approach
- Pre-release and deployment timeline
- Risk management and rollback procedures
- Progressive rollout phases with criteria
- Monitoring framework and health checks
- Communication plan
</output_specification>

<quality_criteria>
Excellent outputs will:
- Match rollout strategy to stated risk tolerance
- Include specific monitoring metrics with thresholds
- Provide clear rollback triggers and step-by-step procedures
- Build validation checkpoints between rollout phases
- Account for different user segments in rollout

Avoid:
- All-at-once deployments for high-risk releases
- Missing or vague rollback procedures
- Unclear success criteria for each phase
- Release plans without stakeholder communication
- Monitoring without actionable thresholds
</quality_criteria>

<constraints>
- Respect stated SLA requirements
- Account for compliance requirements
- Design for available infrastructure capabilities
- Consider team capacity for monitoring and response
</constraints>

## Example Usage

### Input

```
Software: SaaS web application with API (enterprise customers)
Deployment: Cloud-native AWS, Kubernetes, microservices architecture
Release scope: Major feature - new analytics dashboard, API v2 (breaking changes), performance improvements
Users: 5,000 enterprise customers globally, 24/7 usage patterns
Risk tolerance: Moderate - need reliability but want to move fast

Requirements: 99.9% uptime SLA, response times under 2 seconds, PCI compliance
Current process: Basic CI/CD with staging environment, manual deployments to production
Team: 12 engineers across 3 teams
Timeline: Target release March 15, 2025
```

### Output

**Release Strategy**

_Release_: Analytics Dashboard 2.5 (Major)
_Approach_: Blue-Green Deployment with Progressive Rollout
_Target Date_: March 15, 2025

_Deployment Strategy_

- Blue-Green Setup: Maintain current production (blue) while deploying new version (green)
- Progressive Rollout: 1% -> 5% -> 25% -> 50% -> 100% over 7 days
- Feature Flags: Analytics dashboard behind flag for gradual feature activation
- API v2: Parallel deployment with v1, gradual migration

_Rationale_
Blue-green provides instant rollback capability essential for enterprise SLA. Progressive rollout allows validation at each stage while limiting blast radius of potential issues.

**Release Timeline**

_Pre-Release Phase (Weeks 1-8)_

Week 1-4: Development Completion

- Performance testing (load, stress, endurance)
- Security testing and PCI compliance validation
- API v2 backward compatibility verification

Week 7-8: Pre-Production Validation
