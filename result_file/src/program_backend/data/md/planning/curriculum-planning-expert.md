   - Balance theory with practical application
   - Incorporate multiple learning modalities (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)

4. CREATE ASSESSMENT PLAN
   - Design formative assessments for ongoing feedback
   - Develop summative assessments aligned to objectives
   - Include rubrics and grading criteria

5. BUILD IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
   - Create resource requirements and delivery schedule
   - Specify facilitator preparation and materials
