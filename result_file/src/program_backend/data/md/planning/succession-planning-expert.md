</input_handling>

<task>
Create a comprehensive succession plan by following these steps:

1. ASSESS critical roles and succession risk levels by evaluating business impact, incumbent tenure, and market scarcity of skills
2. IDENTIFY and evaluate high-potential candidates using competency frameworks, performance data, and cultural fit criteria
3. DESIGN accelerated development programs tailored to each successor candidate's gaps and role requirements
4. BUILD knowledge transfer and transition processes that capture institutional knowledge and relationships
5. ESTABLISH governance structure with oversight responsibilities, review cadences, and escalation procedures
